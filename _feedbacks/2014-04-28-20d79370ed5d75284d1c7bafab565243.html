    is a pleasure to \"meet\" someone very literate who is also a believer. I humbly
    consider myself to be cut from that same cloth. I noticed from your blog that
    you are starting grad school in the fall. Congrats and best wishes! Before then,
    I wanted to send you a proposal on a novel I wrote that addresses the evol/creation
    question in what I think is a provocative and thoughtful (non-preachy) way. If
    you have time to skim the proposal, I would be very grateful. If you have time
    to read the book, I would be overjoyed. It is a story that needs to be told. What
    is the truth? In a nutshell, life can evolve. Few thinking people would deny that.
    But to overstep the data and claim that all life on Earth evolved is just science-fiction,
    yet science--uncharacteristically I might add--refuses to stay in its lane and
    asserts the most outrageous balderdash. It's highly unscientific, yet some of
    the most prestigious scientists engage in this, when they should know better.
    As a scientist and a christian I find both sides lacking on this issue. With this
    book, I am trying to start a dialog that will get both sides to admit what they
    do and don't know so that non-scientists can get a better focus on the real picture.

    Is it Chance or is it a God? Make this beautiful and masterfully written fiction
    your own journey to answering the age-old existential question of how we and the
    biosphere arrived here. When Cent and Jeshie, two young, very different but equally
    talented artists are tasked with painting murals, they depart on a journey that
    forces them to confront their beliefs about life, art, and the meaning of \"creation.\"
    They are thrown into a mysterious and exciting whirlwind of culture, science,
    history, and love—a thrilling, provocative, cerebral adventure that will challenge
    your belief structures, and at its end, leave you satisfied that you took the
    ride.\r\n \r\nOverview: Do you believe in evolution or creation? On the one hand,
    it is hard to believe that a supernatural being hand made every last thing on
    our planet, down to mosquitoes or the tetanus bacteria; on the other hand, few
    of us have witnessed the birth of our children, felt the magical, inexpressible
    joy and wonder of new life entering the world, and wanted to exclaim, “Look what
    evolution has begot”! This is why many people believe and feel that there is a
    bit of truth on both sides of this often divisive issue. While there are those
    who straddle the fence, there are also extremists on both sides who are so entrenched
    in their position that often rational, clear-headed discussion on the topic seems
    to get obviated by name calling and mudslinging. \r\n \r\nJCEG is the story of
    two artists who seek “beauty in truth” and the face of God through their commissions.
    It weaves a complex tales in which one character—pious and disciplined—spends
    his righteous life trying to find a God who won’t speak to him while the other
    character—often cavalier and doubtful—finds God in spite of himself. If also tackles
    the multi-faceted question of what it means to be a creator in any field, and
    how a novel notion about creation might help to explain the role that “natural
    selection” would play in the work of a whimsical, ever changing God.\r\n \r\nAudience:
    This book is written for anyone who is still trying to answer the question: How
    did we get here? It is written for the 32% of Americans (about 100 million people)
    who are categorized as believing in “theistic evolution” (evolution aided or facilitated
    by a divine being). The book does NOT preach one message or another, but tenderly
    crafts a story in which readers can find their own truth. \r\n.\r\nSample Chapter/s\r\nNote:
    All work is excerpted from chapters unless enclosed in (*)\r\n \r\nChap 2: Jeshie
    grew in mind and spirit, as well as talent, and it didn’t take long before he
    outgrew these childhood scribbles; all of central Italy was talking about his
    talent. He was soon tapped for formal training and tutelage. Although Jeshie was
    a lovely boy of average birth (some might call him poor), his abilities opened
    the most famous doors in Italy—fearlessly, he walked right though.\r\n…\r\nHe
    was charming and outgoing—surprisingly poised and well-spoken for one of such
    few years. He had the manner of a great statesman even at his tender age; in years
    gone by people would stop and wonder what kind of childhood could have shaped
    such a stellar specimen. Then his elders would laugh and shake their heads, saying
    only, “As a child, he was shorter.”\r\n \r\nChap 3: Just across the northern border
    of France, an equally impressive young artist was developing—unloved and misshapen—into
    a powerful, pitiable force. His frail mind and body housed a ferocious talent,
    who—like a weed growing from under a sidewalk—struggled toward the light.\r\n…\r\nThis
    young child, whom everyone called Cent, was neutral looking and untalkative. He
    was forceful—far, far beyond his years. He didn’t laugh or play or rabble-rouse
    as other boys…he lived life with the intensity of a Mayfly, thinking only of how
    to reproduce himself intellectually, artistically, or spiritually, before his
    end would come.\r\n…\r\nBarns and straw make for sporadic sleep, and many was
    the night that Cent stayed awake for hours—shivering in the cold, or itching in
    the straw. He would pass his time in prayer, never in pity or questions, but simply
    asking God to make use of him. During one of these nights, where he was as much
    mumbling to himself as communing with a higher power, an odd thing happened. Sometime
    during these musings, Cent heard a creak, a snap, and then several chunks of beautiful
    cherry wood fell in a jumble in front of him. Whether it was the hallucinations
    of sleeplessness, the necessity of probability, or the actuality of Divine Intervention,
    the pieces were composed of the exact size and shape, and were juxtaposed in such
    a way—at least in Cent’s mind—as to suggest the Christ child in the manger scene.
    Even more bizarre, when Cent looked up on the ledge, he saw a carving knife that
    he swore had not been there before.\r\n…\r\nCent was entranced by this story (Daniel,
    Chap 8) and strengthened by the fact that God could and did indeed foretell the
    future, at least when it suited Him. It was true that Alexander united the then
    city-states of Greece into a true kingdom, becoming its first king; it was true
    that he crossed an unfathomable expanse of the world at such a pace, it appeared
    that he was “crossing the whole earth without touching the ground; it was true
    that he was “broken off” at the height of his power (age 33); it was true that
    his kingdom did not pass to his as yet unborn son, Alexander IV, or his half-brother,
    Philip, but to four of his squabbling generals (which broke the empire into the
    Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Seleucid, the Pergamon, and the Macedon). So on every count
    that Daniel recorded, (200 years before Alexander was born), God seemed to be
    right.\r\n \r\nChap 5 (Jeshie and Cent each receive their commission)\r\n \r\nChap
    6 “You see son, we have wanted to keep this project (the “Ascent of Man” mural
    to be painted at the Royal Science Academy) a secret, because there are those
    in England, and on the continent too, who would think it—well, if not exactly
    inappropriate—at least suspect.” This time it was the director himself who chimed
    in.  “But we—and by ‘we’ I mean this august body in front of whom you now sit—have
    decided that after all is said and done, we’d like the project to go in a new
    direction, to capture some groundbreaking work—(laughing) quite literally—that
    is just now shedding a whole new light on huge sections of science, work that
    will set it on its proper pedestal, work so visionary that it should be the touchstone
    of this whole institute.  The theory of which I’m speaking is none other than
    the one proposed by that most esteemed discoverer/explorer/intellect….” But the
    chairman was not able to finish. As he was building to a crescendo there was a
    sudden knock at the door.\r\n \r\n(Jeshie attends the lecture at which Darwin
    presents “The Origin of Species.”)\r\n \r\nChap 8 (In which Cent’s friend, Opa,
    tries to make an arrangement between himself and a woman he wants to marry, named
    Cleo.)\r\n \r\nShe decided, his personality was probably a mélange of hard work
    from an early age, parents who were strict disciplinarians, and a cluster of siblings
    who provided at least some affection and camaraderie. That said, there was still
    a sorrow and melancholy about him which she couldn’t explain. She hoped this lovely
    Cleo could bring some light into his austere world.\r\nChap 9 (Jeshie meets a
    Newton scholar who helps him understand Newton’s views on God, and how these were
    reflected in and motivation for many of his discoveries).\r\n \r\nChap 10 (Jeshie
    meets the “red-eyed man” who tried to convince him of the importance of Darwin’s
    work, or at the very least, that he should remain neutral about the theory and
    paint the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested by the Royals Science Academy.)\r\n
    \r\nChap 11 (Jeshie meets a young girl who will help him on his journey for truth.)
    One day he was sitting, watching, and eating a pear—his favorite fruit—when a
    slip of a girl ambled by, lithe and fit, more dancing than walking really, as
    the care she put in the simple act of placing her feet revealed her natural agility.
    Jeshie, who hadn’t thought much about these things until this moment, was instantly
    transfixed.\r\n…\r\n“Oh, let me introduce myself. I’m…” just then a sparrow lit
    on her shoulder, startling her for a moment, but charming them both—it was such
    a rare event for such a skittish creature.\r\n…\r\nA moment later, the blissful
    feeling in their hearts and souls bubbled up to their consciousness, and they
    were promptly embarrassed, as one standing naked in a shower is immediately chagrined
    if someone enters unexpectedly, whereas just moments ago they were contented in
    their nakedness.\r\n…\r\nAs nature would have it, one of them had to break the
    awkwardness that was now thick between them, but just as surely, neither of these
    brave souls wanted to be the first to blink. Oddly, after sitting a moment, the
    uneasiness past, and both looked at the sparrow at their feet, and then simultaneously
    reached for each other’s hand. They sat for some time, just being, listening to
    the chirps and the wind and the music of nature.\r\n…\r\n(Jeshie has another encounter
    with the red-eyed man, who again tries to convince him to paint “The Ascent of
    Man.) Relieved at having made a decision, or at least accepting the one that arose
    within him, he trotted off to the drawing room to tell Herr Redd the news. Jogging
    past the west bed of DaVinci’s Garden, he noticed a Brazilian Blue butterfly sitting
    on a lily. He was curious as to what it would be doing wild in Italy, since that
    species of Lepidoptera were not found outside of the tropics. Nevertheless, it
    sat there, indolently beating its gorgeous, shockingly azure, wings. Jeshie twisted
    his head as he ran past her, somehow wanting to break neither his stride nor his
    view. Naturally, the two were incompatible, and since he refused to look away
    from the blue treasure, he tripped and flew a few feet down the walkway before
    coming back down to earth.\r\n \r\nJeshie—fairly coordinated—fell gently, then
    slid to an easy stop with just a skinned knee and a cut hand. Still lying on the
    ground, he looked at his bleeding palm—the splash of red dripping to the ground
    broke his blue reverie. He hopped up, anxious to compose himself; he brushed off
    his knee, and wiped his flesh a few times, to remove the blood. When he looked
    again, the butterfly was gone.\r\n.\r\nChap 13 (Cent’s commission is finished
    and revealed to an audience who doesn’t quite understand it but tries to be polite.
    He feels shunned, as usual, and decides to take a walk out of town by himself,
    where he encounters the red-eyed man.)\r\n \r\nCent never paid attention to time,
    but from the height of the moon, he knew it couldn’t be too late. He didn’t want
    to worry the organizers, nor did he want to try their patience. On his way back
    into town, he saw a smoldering ember hovering above the ground. As he drew closer,
    he smelled a hint of Cuban tobacco, rare in Europe, but he knew its scent from
    a certain Parisian salon he had frequented on his way to Terramo. There was a
    man, leaning against the barn door, smoking a cigar. Cent caught a glimpse of
    his face, and noticed that the man’s eyes seemed to have an eerie glow. Cent slowed
    his pace, in a rare display of curiosity, and waited for the man to speak. The
    smoker said nothing, but gazed deeply into Cent’s face. There was nothing to say
    that couldn’t be communicated with the simple smirk he was wearing. Cent tried
    to pass, but the man threw out his hand and grabbed his shoulder.  Cent felt a
    sharp pain shoot down his arm, and smelled a hint of seared flesh. Just as quickly,
    the man released him, and slid into the night.\r\n \r\nCent returned to his straw
    cot in the little shed behind the church; he sat for some time with his head in
    his hands and stared at the floor, trying to make sense of all that had transpired.
    He did not have any luck.\r\n \r\nChap 15 (Jeshie is whisked away to a secret
    castle where he is given some special training to help him decide how to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” commission, or if to paint it at all. He meets Madame Curie,
    who gives him some chemical insights into the nature of life. He is also presented
    with a two-sided scroll that contains reasons for and against believing in “natural
    selection.”\r\n \r\nMadame Curie: “I’m not one to lecture, Jeshie, but there is
    one thing I would like to share with you in your search. It is this: Biology is
    nothing more than chemistry—living chemistry,” here she paused, to see if he would
    get the meaning of her words.\r\n \r\n“So, for natural selection to be true, in
    the final analysis, it must be that all of life on earth has come from an unending
    series of cascading chemical reactions. If you can believe that, then you know
    what to do.”\r\n \r\nCent 16 (Cleo rejects Cent, and despite his relentless pursuit
    for the face of God, he begins his descent into madness.)\r\n \r\nChap 18 (Cent
    and Jeshie meet. Cent explains his theory of “facilitated evolution.”)\r\n \r\n“Imagine
    our world, the world you and I and few others inhabit: we sketch an idea in pencil
    or charcoal; we grab a canvas and set it on an easel; we apply the color palette
    to the sides of the canvas—the lime green, turquoise blue, canary yellow, and
    dove white that we want in the final piece…then, do you know what would happen
    next?\r\n…\r\n“You see the beauty in this, Jeshie, the efficiency, the delight.
    What artist—of any genre—wouldn’t like to put some ideas on paper or canvas or
    some few notes to a score of music, only to return later to find the work complete.
    Can you imagine? Quelle surprise!  The shock, the delight, the amazement we would
    feel if we could animate the artistic process, and wait to see what became of
    it?” Here Cent paused to carefully study Jeshie’s face, to ascertain if his colleague
    was comprehending his meaning.\r\n \r\nA moment later, he continued his verbal
    barrage: “I know what you’re thinking: at first it sounds too fabulous to be believed,
    but don’t yet reject my hypothesis…flow with my idea, imagine what great fun we
    as artists would have to set up the outline and color of the composition…” and
    here he paused and took a long draught of fresh coffee… “and come back later to
    find the fait accompli. To animate, in the literal sense of the word, the creative
    process. What would you think of that, Jeshie? Let your mind believe it for a
    moment. Can you see the beauty in it?”\r\n \r\nChap 19 (Jeshie decides to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested and has finished it.) Finally, after months
    of exertion, the day arrived when he was nearly finished. He climbed off the ladder,
    slid it to the side, and gazed upon the creation. He breathed deeply, and then
    exhaled. He was pleased. He saw that it was good. Everything was in proportion—balanced,
    meaningful. He had not wasted a stroke, nor needlessly embellished. He had put
    on the wall what had been in his mind. He dropped to his knees and gazing unconsciously
    towards the heavens he offered up a whispered prayer: “Abba, Father, with you
    all things are possible.”\r\n…\r\n(He goes to his room to sleep, mentally and
    physically exhausted.) He napped for hours, and by the time he awoke, it was well
    passed the middle of the night. He brushed his teeth, put on his sleepwear, and
    slid under the covers. This time as he slept, it was not so restful—he tossed
    on cotton waves, and emitted fitful cries.\r\n…\r\nJeshie awoke, in an almost
    somnambulist state, with the dream still playing in his head, and walked down
    to the Academy entranceway. There was a glow from the candles that were still
    lit, which gave the room an eerie and primordial look. Seen through this haze,
    Jeshie looked at the mural, and realized something was wrong. In this light, at
    this time of night, and with subconscious clarity, it was clear that something
    was missing. The mural was too literal, too exact; it seemed to obviate the possibilities
    that must have been ripe at the founding of the world. It was a tribute to natural
    selection, but it seemed hollow and empty, as if the marvel of life could be boiled
    down to a precise definition, when Jeshie knew intuitively, viscerally, that this
    wasn’t so. If life was anything, it was miraculous. This painting stripped it
    of its wonder.\r\n \r\nNatural selection mandates that there is something from
    which to select—but from where did these first entities come? Jeshie didn’t know;
    he didn’t have all the answers. But one thing had always guided him through his
    life, and he needed to pay homage to it here: he needed to show the necessity
    of energy—of vibrations—in the assembling of the universe. Hadn’t Madame Weiss
    affirmed the “cosmic battery,” whether or not this was God?\r\n \r\nWith this
    nugget of an idea in his head, Jeshie returned to bed, fell asleep, and let his
    subconscious mind wrestle with the demons.\r\n \r\nJeshie awoke and went behind
    the curtain for the final time to complete the finishing touches; it was the 4th
    of April. Jeshie took a wash of shimmering translucent silver paint, and above
    the clouds on the top right-hand side of the picture, he painted twelve evenly
    spaced circles, followed by three unevenly spaced ones.\r\n…\r\nAfter months and
    months of fussing over every stroke he was finally done.\r\n \r\nChap 20 (Jeshie’s
    mural is presented, and its “secret” content is revealed when candle light refracts
    off it at just the right angle.)\r\n \r\n“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this
    grand evening that’s a celebration of free thinking and intelligence. A celebration
    of natural selection and rationality.”\r\n \r\nAt this, the Queen cleared her
    throat, perhaps she needed to, or perhaps she was hoping the Dean was not going
    to pontificate half the night. She was curious to see the work, but nothing more.
    And shecertainly didn’t need anyone telling her what to think or how to feel about
    it.\r\n \r\nAt the sound of the queen’s throat clearing, the Dean shortened his
    speech. “Ah, right—a picture is worth a thousand words, and this august body of
    attendees has no need of me to tell them of its importance. So, without further
    ado, I give you, ‘The Ascent of Man.’”\r\n…\r\nAt this time, with the angle of
    the light’s refraction, Jeshie’s riddle could be clearly seen: little translucent
    circles in which was painted FFGA AGFE DDEF FEE. The guests stared for a moment,
    and even the queen was transfixed. Since in attendance were some of the brightest
    minds in Europe, it shouldn’t take long for them to decipher the clue.\r\n…\r\nWith
    that, the first violinist walked up to the Dean. “Excuse me sir, are you still
    trying to solve the riddle?\r\n \r\n“Not now, musician, can’t you see we’re busy
    looking for this scoundrel. Besides, the greatest minds in Europe are here tonight;
    we certainly don’t need a fiddler to solve the puzzle.”\r\n…\r\n“But sir, we’ve
    solved the conundrum. Any musician could so do. Dum, dum, dum, dum (voice rising)…dum,
    dum, dum, dum (voice falling)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice flat)…dummm, dum’, dum’.
    You know it of course, sir: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.”\r\n \r\n“Clever lad,” said
    the Queen.\r\n \r\n“Ingrate,” said the Dean.\r\n \r\n“I understand,” said a nameless
    guest. And he muttered to no one in particular: “With a few simple notes he has
    shown that it is absurd to believe that evolution begat music.”\r\n \r\n(The remainder
    of the book consists of Jeshie and Marie eluding their predators, growing in additional
    knowledge about creation, and then a final resolution.)\";}"

    All work is excerpted from chapters unless enclosed in (*)\r\n \r\nChap 2: Jeshie
    grew in mind and spirit, as well as talent, and it didn’t take long before he
    outgrew these childhood scribbles; all of central Italy was talking about his
    talent. He was soon tapped for formal training and tutelage. Although Jeshie was
    a lovely boy of average birth (some might call him poor), his abilities opened
    the most famous doors in Italy—fearlessly, he walked right though.\r\n…\r\nHe
    was charming and outgoing—surprisingly poised and well-spoken for one of such
    few years. He had the manner of a great statesman even at his tender age; in years
    gone by people would stop and wonder what kind of childhood could have shaped
    such a stellar specimen. Then his elders would laugh and shake their heads, saying
    only, “As a child, he was shorter.”\r\n \r\nChap 3: Just across the northern border
    of France, an equally impressive young artist was developing—unloved and misshapen—into
    a powerful, pitiable force. His frail mind and body housed a ferocious talent,
    who—like a weed growing from under a sidewalk—struggled toward the light.\r\n…\r\nThis
    young child, whom everyone called Cent, was neutral looking and untalkative. He
    was forceful—far, far beyond his years. He didn’t laugh or play or rabble-rouse
    as other boys…he lived life with the intensity of a Mayfly, thinking only of how
    to reproduce himself intellectually, artistically, or spiritually, before his
    end would come.\r\n…\r\nBarns and straw make for sporadic sleep, and many was
    the night that Cent stayed awake for hours—shivering in the cold, or itching in
    the straw. He would pass his time in prayer, never in pity or questions, but simply
    asking God to make use of him. During one of these nights, where he was as much
    mumbling to himself as communing with a higher power, an odd thing happened. Sometime
    during these musings, Cent heard a creak, a snap, and then several chunks of beautiful
    cherry wood fell in a jumble in front of him. Whether it was the hallucinations
    of sleeplessness, the necessity of probability, or the actuality of Divine Intervention,
    the pieces were composed of the exact size and shape, and were juxtaposed in such
    a way—at least in Cent’s mind—as to suggest the Christ child in the manger scene.
    Even more bizarre, when Cent looked up on the ledge, he saw a carving knife that
    he swore had not been there before.\r\n…\r\nCent was entranced by this story (Daniel,
    Chap 8) and strengthened by the fact that God could and did indeed foretell the
    future, at least when it suited Him. It was true that Alexander united the then
    city-states of Greece into a true kingdom, becoming its first king; it was true
    that he crossed an unfathomable expanse of the world at such a pace, it appeared
    that he was “crossing the whole earth without touching the ground; it was true
    that he was “broken off” at the height of his power (age 33); it was true that
    his kingdom did not pass to his as yet unborn son, Alexander IV, or his half-brother,
    Philip, but to four of his squabbling generals (which broke the empire into the
    Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Seleucid, the Pergamon, and the Macedon). So on every count
    that Daniel recorded, (200 years before Alexander was born), God seemed to be
    right.\r\n \r\nChap 5 (Jeshie and Cent each receive their commission)\r\n \r\nChap
    6 “You see son, we have wanted to keep this project (the “Ascent of Man” mural
    to be painted at the Royal Science Academy) a secret, because there are those
    in England, and on the continent too, who would think it—well, if not exactly
    inappropriate—at least suspect.” This time it was the director himself who chimed
    in.  “But we—and by ‘we’ I mean this august body in front of whom you now sit—have
    decided that after all is said and done, we’d like the project to go in a new
    direction, to capture some groundbreaking work—(laughing) quite literally—that
    is just now shedding a whole new light on huge sections of science, work that
    will set it on its proper pedestal, work so visionary that it should be the touchstone
    of this whole institute.  The theory of which I’m speaking is none other than
    the one proposed by that most esteemed discoverer/explorer/intellect….” But the
    chairman was not able to finish. As he was building to a crescendo there was a
    sudden knock at the door.\r\n \r\n(Jeshie attends the lecture at which Darwin
    presents “The Origin of Species.”)\r\n \r\nChap 8 (In which Cent’s friend, Opa,
    tries to make an arrangement between himself and a woman he wants to marry, named
    Cleo.)\r\n \r\nShe decided, his personality was probably a mélange of hard work
    from an early age, parents who were strict disciplinarians, and a cluster of siblings
    who provided at least some affection and camaraderie. That said, there was still
    a sorrow and melancholy about him which she couldn’t explain. She hoped this lovely
    Cleo could bring some light into his austere world.\r\nChap 9 (Jeshie meets a
    Newton scholar who helps him understand Newton’s views on God, and how these were
    reflected in and motivation for many of his discoveries).\r\n \r\nChap 10 (Jeshie
    meets the “red-eyed man” who tried to convince him of the importance of Darwin’s
    work, or at the very least, that he should remain neutral about the theory and
    paint the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested by the Royals Science Academy.)\r\n
    \r\nChap 11 (Jeshie meets a young girl who will help him on his journey for truth.)
    One day he was sitting, watching, and eating a pear—his favorite fruit—when a
    slip of a girl ambled by, lithe and fit, more dancing than walking really, as
    the care she put in the simple act of placing her feet revealed her natural agility.
    Jeshie, who hadn’t thought much about these things until this moment, was instantly
    transfixed.\r\n…\r\n“Oh, let me introduce myself. I’m…” just then a sparrow lit
    on her shoulder, startling her for a moment, but charming them both—it was such
    a rare event for such a skittish creature.\r\n…\r\nA moment later, the blissful
    feeling in their hearts and souls bubbled up to their consciousness, and they
    were promptly embarrassed, as one standing naked in a shower is immediately chagrined
    if someone enters unexpectedly, whereas just moments ago they were contented in
    their nakedness.\r\n…\r\nAs nature would have it, one of them had to break the
    awkwardness that was now thick between them, but just as surely, neither of these
    brave souls wanted to be the first to blink. Oddly, after sitting a moment, the
    uneasiness past, and both looked at the sparrow at their feet, and then simultaneously
    reached for each other’s hand. They sat for some time, just being, listening to
    the chirps and the wind and the music of nature.\r\n…\r\n(Jeshie has another encounter
    with the red-eyed man, who again tries to convince him to paint “The Ascent of
    Man.) Relieved at having made a decision, or at least accepting the one that arose
    within him, he trotted off to the drawing room to tell Herr Redd the news. Jogging
    past the west bed of DaVinci’s Garden, he noticed a Brazilian Blue butterfly sitting
    on a lily. He was curious as to what it would be doing wild in Italy, since that
    species of Lepidoptera were not found outside of the tropics. Nevertheless, it
    sat there, indolently beating its gorgeous, shockingly azure, wings. Jeshie twisted
    his head as he ran past her, somehow wanting to break neither his stride nor his
    view. Naturally, the two were incompatible, and since he refused to look away
    from the blue treasure, he tripped and flew a few feet down the walkway before
    coming back down to earth.\r\n \r\nJeshie—fairly coordinated—fell gently, then
    slid to an easy stop with just a skinned knee and a cut hand. Still lying on the
    ground, he looked at his bleeding palm—the splash of red dripping to the ground
    broke his blue reverie. He hopped up, anxious to compose himself; he brushed off
    his knee, and wiped his flesh a few times, to remove the blood. When he looked
    again, the butterfly was gone.\r\n.\r\nChap 13 (Cent’s commission is finished
    and revealed to an audience who doesn’t quite understand it but tries to be polite.
    He feels shunned, as usual, and decides to take a walk out of town by himself,
    where he encounters the red-eyed man.)\r\n \r\nCent never paid attention to time,
    but from the height of the moon, he knew it couldn’t be too late. He didn’t want
    to worry the organizers, nor did he want to try their patience. On his way back
    into town, he saw a smoldering ember hovering above the ground. As he drew closer,
    he smelled a hint of Cuban tobacco, rare in Europe, but he knew its scent from
    a certain Parisian salon he had frequented on his way to Terramo. There was a
    man, leaning against the barn door, smoking a cigar. Cent caught a glimpse of
    his face, and noticed that the man’s eyes seemed to have an eerie glow. Cent slowed
    his pace, in a rare display of curiosity, and waited for the man to speak. The
    smoker said nothing, but gazed deeply into Cent’s face. There was nothing to say
    that couldn’t be communicated with the simple smirk he was wearing. Cent tried
    to pass, but the man threw out his hand and grabbed his shoulder.  Cent felt a
    sharp pain shoot down his arm, and smelled a hint of seared flesh. Just as quickly,
    the man released him, and slid into the night.\r\n \r\nCent returned to his straw
    cot in the little shed behind the church; he sat for some time with his head in
    his hands and stared at the floor, trying to make sense of all that had transpired.
    He did not have any luck.\r\n \r\nChap 15 (Jeshie is whisked away to a secret
    castle where he is given some special training to help him decide how to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” commission, or if to paint it at all. He meets Madame Curie,
    who gives him some chemical insights into the nature of life. He is also presented
    with a two-sided scroll that contains reasons for and against believing in “natural
    selection.”\r\n \r\nMadame Curie: “I’m not one to lecture, Jeshie, but there is
    one thing I would like to share with you in your search. It is this: Biology is
    nothing more than chemistry—living chemistry,” here she paused, to see if he would
    get the meaning of her words.\r\n \r\n“So, for natural selection to be true, in
    the final analysis, it must be that all of life on earth has come from an unending
    series of cascading chemical reactions. If you can believe that, then you know
    what to do.”\r\n \r\nCent 16 (Cleo rejects Cent, and despite his relentless pursuit
    for the face of God, he begins his descent into madness.)\r\n \r\nChap 18 (Cent
    and Jeshie meet. Cent explains his theory of “facilitated evolution.”)\r\n \r\n“Imagine
    our world, the world you and I and few others inhabit: we sketch an idea in pencil
    or charcoal; we grab a canvas and set it on an easel; we apply the color palette
    to the sides of the canvas—the lime green, turquoise blue, canary yellow, and
    dove white that we want in the final piece…then, do you know what would happen
    next?\r\n…\r\n“You see the beauty in this, Jeshie, the efficiency, the delight.
    What artist—of any genre—wouldn’t like to put some ideas on paper or canvas or
    some few notes to a score of music, only to return later to find the work complete.
    Can you imagine? Quelle surprise!  The shock, the delight, the amazement we would
    feel if we could animate the artistic process, and wait to see what became of
    it?” Here Cent paused to carefully study Jeshie’s face, to ascertain if his colleague
    was comprehending his meaning.\r\n \r\nA moment later, he continued his verbal
    barrage: “I know what you’re thinking: at first it sounds too fabulous to be believed,
    but don’t yet reject my hypothesis…flow with my idea, imagine what great fun we
    as artists would have to set up the outline and color of the composition…” and
    here he paused and took a long draught of fresh coffee… “and come back later to
    find the fait accompli. To animate, in the literal sense of the word, the creative
    process. What would you think of that, Jeshie? Let your mind believe it for a
    moment. Can you see the beauty in it?”\r\n \r\nChap 19 (Jeshie decides to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested and has finished it.) Finally, after months
    of exertion, the day arrived when he was nearly finished. He climbed off the ladder,
    slid it to the side, and gazed upon the creation. He breathed deeply, and then
    exhaled. He was pleased. He saw that it was good. Everything was in proportion—balanced,
    meaningful. He had not wasted a stroke, nor needlessly embellished. He had put
    on the wall what had been in his mind. He dropped to his knees and gazing unconsciously
    towards the heavens he offered up a whispered prayer: “Abba, Father, with you
    all things are possible.”\r\n…\r\n(He goes to his room to sleep, mentally and
    physically exhausted.) He napped for hours, and by the time he awoke, it was well
    passed the middle of the night. He brushed his teeth, put on his sleepwear, and
    slid under the covers. This time as he slept, it was not so restful—he tossed
    on cotton waves, and emitted fitful cries.\r\n…\r\nJeshie awoke, in an almost
    somnambulist state, with the dream still playing in his head, and walked down
    to the Academy entranceway. There was a glow from the candles that were still
    lit, which gave the room an eerie and primordial look. Seen through this haze,
    Jeshie looked at the mural, and realized something was wrong. In this light, at
    this time of night, and with subconscious clarity, it was clear that something
    was missing. The mural was too literal, too exact; it seemed to obviate the possibilities
    that must have been ripe at the founding of the world. It was a tribute to natural
    selection, but it seemed hollow and empty, as if the marvel of life could be boiled
    down to a precise definition, when Jeshie knew intuitively, viscerally, that this
    wasn’t so. If life was anything, it was miraculous. This painting stripped it
    of its wonder.\r\n \r\nNatural selection mandates that there is something from
    which to select—but from where did these first entities come? Jeshie didn’t know;
    he didn’t have all the answers. But one thing had always guided him through his
    life, and he needed to pay homage to it here: he needed to show the necessity
    of energy—of vibrations—in the assembling of the universe. Hadn’t Madame Weiss
    affirmed the “cosmic battery,” whether or not this was God?\r\n \r\nWith this
    nugget of an idea in his head, Jeshie returned to bed, fell asleep, and let his
    subconscious mind wrestle with the demons.\r\n \r\nJeshie awoke and went behind
    the curtain for the final time to complete the finishing touches; it was the 4th
    of April. Jeshie took a wash of shimmering translucent silver paint, and above
    the clouds on the top right-hand side of the picture, he painted twelve evenly
    spaced circles, followed by three unevenly spaced ones.\r\n…\r\nAfter months and
    months of fussing over every stroke he was finally done.\r\n \r\nChap 20 (Jeshie’s
    mural is presented, and its “secret” content is revealed when candle light refracts
    off it at just the right angle.)\r\n \r\n“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this
    grand evening that’s a celebration of free thinking and intelligence. A celebration
    of natural selection and rationality.”\r\n \r\nAt this, the Queen cleared her
    throat, perhaps she needed to, or perhaps she was hoping the Dean was not going
    to pontificate half the night. She was curious to see the work, but nothing more.
    And shecertainly didn’t need anyone telling her what to think or how to feel about
    it.\r\n \r\nAt the sound of the queen’s throat clearing, the Dean shortened his
    speech. “Ah, right—a picture is worth a thousand words, and this august body of
    attendees has no need of me to tell them of its importance. So, without further
    ado, I give you, ‘The Ascent of Man.’”\r\n…\r\nAt this time, with the angle of
    the light’s refraction, Jeshie’s riddle could be clearly seen: little translucent
    circles in which was painted FFGA AGFE DDEF FEE. The guests stared for a moment,
    and even the queen was transfixed. Since in attendance were some of the brightest
    minds in Europe, it shouldn’t take long for them to decipher the clue.\r\n…\r\nWith
    that, the first violinist walked up to the Dean. “Excuse me sir, are you still
    trying to solve the riddle?\r\n \r\n“Not now, musician, can’t you see we’re busy
    looking for this scoundrel. Besides, the greatest minds in Europe are here tonight;
    we certainly don’t need a fiddler to solve the puzzle.”\r\n…\r\n“But sir, we’ve
    solved the conundrum. Any musician could so do. Dum, dum, dum, dum (voice rising)…dum,
    dum, dum, dum (voice falling)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice flat)…dummm, dum’, dum’.
    You know it of course, sir: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.”\r\n \r\n“Clever lad,” said
    the Queen.\r\n \r\n“Ingrate,” said the Dean.\r\n \r\n“I understand,” said a nameless
    guest. And he muttered to no one in particular: “With a few simple notes he has
    shown that it is absurd to believe that evolution begat music.”\r\n \r\n(The remainder
    of the book consists of Jeshie and Marie eluding their predators, growing in additional
    knowledge about creation, and then a final resolution.)\";s:12:\"comment_type\";s:12:\"contact_form\";s:7:\"user_ip\";s:14:\"24.160.222.116\";s:10:\"user_agent\";s:109:\"Mozilla/5.0

    lallimj@yahoo.com\nWebsite: \nComment: It is a pleasure to \"meet\" someone very
    literate who is also a believer. I humbly consider myself to be cut from that
    same cloth. I noticed from your blog that you are starting grad school in the
    fall. Congrats and best wishes! Before then, I wanted to send you a proposal on
    a novel I wrote that addresses the evol/creation question in what I think is a
    provocative and thoughtful (non-preachy) way. If you have time to skim the proposal,
    I would be very grateful. If you have time to read the book, I would be overjoyed.
    It is a story that needs to be told. What is the truth? In a nutshell, life can
    evolve. Few thinking people would deny that. But to overstep the data and claim
    that all life on Earth evolved is just science-fiction, yet science--uncharacteristically
    I might add--refuses to stay in its lane and asserts the most outrageous balderdash.
    It's highly unscientific, yet some of the most prestigious scientists engage in
    this, when they should know better. As a scientist and a christian I find both
    sides lacking on this issue. With this book, I am trying to start a dialog that
    will get both sides to admit what they do and don't know so that non-scientists
    can get a better focus on the real picture. Can you help?\r\n.\r\nAuthor Biography:\r\nAuthor

    an academic understanding of the precise strengths and weaknesses of “natural

    written fiction your own journey to answering the age-old existential question
    of how we and the biosphere arrived here. When Cent and Jeshie, two young, very
    different but equally talented artists are tasked with painting murals, they depart
    on a journey that forces them to confront their beliefs about life, art, and the
    meaning of \"creation.\" They are thrown into a mysterious and exciting whirlwind
    of culture, science, history, and love—a thrilling, provocative, cerebral adventure
    that will challenge your belief structures, and at its end, leave you satisfied
    that you took the ride.\r\n \r\nOverview: Do you believe in evolution or creation?
    On the one hand, it is hard to believe that a supernatural being hand made every
    last thing on our planet, down to mosquitoes or the tetanus bacteria; on the other
    hand, few of us have witnessed the birth of our children, felt the magical, inexpressible
    joy and wonder of new life entering the world, and wanted to exclaim, “Look what
    evolution has begot”! This is why many people believe and feel that there is a
    bit of truth on both sides of this often divisive issue. While there are those
    who straddle the fence, there are also extremists on both sides who are so entrenched
    in their position that often rational, clear-headed discussion on the topic seems
    to get obviated by name calling and mudslinging. \r\n \r\nJCEG is the story of
    two artists who seek “beauty in truth” and the face of God through their commissions.
    It weaves a complex tales in which one character—pious and disciplined—spends
    his righteous life trying to find a God who won’t speak to him while the other
    character—often cavalier and doubtful—finds God in spite of himself. If also tackles
    the multi-faceted question of what it means to be a creator in any field, and
    how a novel notion about creation might help to explain the role that “natural
    selection” would play in the work of a whimsical, ever changing God.\r\n \r\nAudience:
    This book is written for anyone who is still trying to answer the question: How
    did we get here? It is written for the 32% of Americans (about 100 million people)
    who are categorized as believing in “theistic evolution” (evolution aided or facilitated
    by a divine being). The book does NOT preach one message or another, but tenderly
    crafts a story in which readers can find their own truth. \r\n.\r\nSample Chapter/s\r\nNote:
    All work is excerpted from chapters unless enclosed in (*)\r\n \r\nChap 2: Jeshie
    grew in mind and spirit, as well as talent, and it didn’t take long before he
    outgrew these childhood scribbles; all of central Italy was talking about his
    talent. He was soon tapped for formal training and tutelage. Although Jeshie was
    a lovely boy of average birth (some might call him poor), his abilities opened
    the most famous doors in Italy—fearlessly, he walked right though.\r\n…\r\nHe
    was charming and outgoing—surprisingly poised and well-spoken for one of such
    few years. He had the manner of a great statesman even at his tender age; in years
    gone by people would stop and wonder what kind of childhood could have shaped
    such a stellar specimen. Then his elders would laugh and shake their heads, saying
    only, “As a child, he was shorter.”\r\n \r\nChap 3: Just across the northern border
    of France, an equally impressive young artist was developing—unloved and misshapen—into
    a powerful, pitiable force. His frail mind and body housed a ferocious talent,
    who—like a weed growing from under a sidewalk—struggled toward the light.\r\n…\r\nThis
    young child, whom everyone called Cent, was neutral looking and untalkative. He
    was forceful—far, far beyond his years. He didn’t laugh or play or rabble-rouse
    as other boys…he lived life with the intensity of a Mayfly, thinking only of how
    to reproduce himself intellectually, artistically, or spiritually, before his
    end would come.\r\n…\r\nBarns and straw make for sporadic sleep, and many was
    the night that Cent stayed awake for hours—shivering in the cold, or itching in
    the straw. He would pass his time in prayer, never in pity or questions, but simply
    asking God to make use of him. During one of these nights, where he was as much
    mumbling to himself as communing with a higher power, an odd thing happened. Sometime
    during these musings, Cent heard a creak, a snap, and then several chunks of beautiful
    cherry wood fell in a jumble in front of him. Whether it was the hallucinations
    of sleeplessness, the necessity of probability, or the actuality of Divine Intervention,
    the pieces were composed of the exact size and shape, and were juxtaposed in such
    a way—at least in Cent’s mind—as to suggest the Christ child in the manger scene.
    Even more bizarre, when Cent looked up on the ledge, he saw a carving knife that
    he swore had not been there before.\r\n…\r\nCent was entranced by this story (Daniel,
    Chap 8) and strengthened by the fact that God could and did indeed foretell the
    future, at least when it suited Him. It was true that Alexander united the then
    city-states of Greece into a true kingdom, becoming its first king; it was true
    that he crossed an unfathomable expanse of the world at such a pace, it appeared
    that he was “crossing the whole earth without touching the ground; it was true
    that he was “broken off” at the height of his power (age 33); it was true that
    his kingdom did not pass to his as yet unborn son, Alexander IV, or his half-brother,
    Philip, but to four of his squabbling generals (which broke the empire into the
    Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Seleucid, the Pergamon, and the Macedon). So on every count
    that Daniel recorded, (200 years before Alexander was born), God seemed to be
    right.\r\n \r\nChap 5 (Jeshie and Cent each receive their commission)\r\n \r\nChap
    6 “You see son, we have wanted to keep this project (the “Ascent of Man” mural
    to be painted at the Royal Science Academy) a secret, because there are those
    in England, and on the continent too, who would think it—well, if not exactly
    inappropriate—at least suspect.” This time it was the director himself who chimed
    in.  “But we—and by ‘we’ I mean this august body in front of whom you now sit—have
    decided that after all is said and done, we’d like the project to go in a new
    direction, to capture some groundbreaking work—(laughing) quite literally—that
    is just now shedding a whole new light on huge sections of science, work that
    will set it on its proper pedestal, work so visionary that it should be the touchstone
    of this whole institute.  The theory of which I’m speaking is none other than
    the one proposed by that most esteemed discoverer/explorer/intellect….” But the
    chairman was not able to finish. As he was building to a crescendo there was a
    sudden knock at the door.\r\n \r\n(Jeshie attends the lecture at which Darwin
    presents “The Origin of Species.”)\r\n \r\nChap 8 (In which Cent’s friend, Opa,
    tries to make an arrangement between himself and a woman he wants to marry, named
    Cleo.)\r\n \r\nShe decided, his personality was probably a mélange of hard work
    from an early age, parents who were strict disciplinarians, and a cluster of siblings
    who provided at least some affection and camaraderie. That said, there was still
    a sorrow and melancholy about him which she couldn’t explain. She hoped this lovely
    Cleo could bring some light into his austere world.\r\nChap 9 (Jeshie meets a
    Newton scholar who helps him understand Newton’s views on God, and how these were
    reflected in and motivation for many of his discoveries).\r\n \r\nChap 10 (Jeshie
    meets the “red-eyed man” who tried to convince him of the importance of Darwin’s
    work, or at the very least, that he should remain neutral about the theory and
    paint the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested by the Royals Science Academy.)\r\n
    \r\nChap 11 (Jeshie meets a young girl who will help him on his journey for truth.)
    One day he was sitting, watching, and eating a pear—his favorite fruit—when a
    slip of a girl ambled by, lithe and fit, more dancing than walking really, as
    the care she put in the simple act of placing her feet revealed her natural agility.
    Jeshie, who hadn’t thought much about these things until this moment, was instantly
    transfixed.\r\n…\r\n“Oh, let me introduce myself. I’m…” just then a sparrow lit
    on her shoulder, startling her for a moment, but charming them both—it was such
    a rare event for such a skittish creature.\r\n…\r\nA moment later, the blissful
    feeling in their hearts and souls bubbled up to their consciousness, and they
    were promptly embarrassed, as one standing naked in a shower is immediately chagrined
    if someone enters unexpectedly, whereas just moments ago they were contented in
    their nakedness.\r\n…\r\nAs nature would have it, one of them had to break the
    awkwardness that was now thick between them, but just as surely, neither of these
    brave souls wanted to be the first to blink. Oddly, after sitting a moment, the
    uneasiness past, and both looked at the sparrow at their feet, and then simultaneously
    reached for each other’s hand. They sat for some time, just being, listening to
    the chirps and the wind and the music of nature.\r\n…\r\n(Jeshie has another encounter
    with the red-eyed man, who again tries to convince him to paint “The Ascent of
    Man.) Relieved at having made a decision, or at least accepting the one that arose
    within him, he trotted off to the drawing room to tell Herr Redd the news. Jogging
    past the west bed of DaVinci’s Garden, he noticed a Brazilian Blue butterfly sitting
    on a lily. He was curious as to what it would be doing wild in Italy, since that
    species of Lepidoptera were not found outside of the tropics. Nevertheless, it
    sat there, indolently beating its gorgeous, shockingly azure, wings. Jeshie twisted
    his head as he ran past her, somehow wanting to break neither his stride nor his
    view. Naturally, the two were incompatible, and since he refused to look away
    from the blue treasure, he tripped and flew a few feet down the walkway before
    coming back down to earth.\r\n \r\nJeshie—fairly coordinated—fell gently, then
    slid to an easy stop with just a skinned knee and a cut hand. Still lying on the
    ground, he looked at his bleeding palm—the splash of red dripping to the ground
    broke his blue reverie. He hopped up, anxious to compose himself; he brushed off
    his knee, and wiped his flesh a few times, to remove the blood. When he looked
    again, the butterfly was gone.\r\n.\r\nChap 13 (Cent’s commission is finished
    and revealed to an audience who doesn’t quite understand it but tries to be polite.
    He feels shunned, as usual, and decides to take a walk out of town by himself,
    where he encounters the red-eyed man.)\r\n \r\nCent never paid attention to time,
    but from the height of the moon, he knew it couldn’t be too late. He didn’t want
    to worry the organizers, nor did he want to try their patience. On his way back
    into town, he saw a smoldering ember hovering above the ground. As he drew closer,
    he smelled a hint of Cuban tobacco, rare in Europe, but he knew its scent from
    a certain Parisian salon he had frequented on his way to Terramo. There was a
    man, leaning against the barn door, smoking a cigar. Cent caught a glimpse of
    his face, and noticed that the man’s eyes seemed to have an eerie glow. Cent slowed
    his pace, in a rare display of curiosity, and waited for the man to speak. The
    smoker said nothing, but gazed deeply into Cent’s face. There was nothing to say
    that couldn’t be communicated with the simple smirk he was wearing. Cent tried
    to pass, but the man threw out his hand and grabbed his shoulder.  Cent felt a
    sharp pain shoot down his arm, and smelled a hint of seared flesh. Just as quickly,
    the man released him, and slid into the night.\r\n \r\nCent returned to his straw
    cot in the little shed behind the church; he sat for some time with his head in
    his hands and stared at the floor, trying to make sense of all that had transpired.
    He did not have any luck.\r\n \r\nChap 15 (Jeshie is whisked away to a secret
    castle where he is given some special training to help him decide how to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” commission, or if to paint it at all. He meets Madame Curie,
    who gives him some chemical insights into the nature of life. He is also presented
    with a two-sided scroll that contains reasons for and against believing in “natural
    selection.”\r\n \r\nMadame Curie: “I’m not one to lecture, Jeshie, but there is
    one thing I would like to share with you in your search. It is this: Biology is
    nothing more than chemistry—living chemistry,” here she paused, to see if he would
    get the meaning of her words.\r\n \r\n“So, for natural selection to be true, in
    the final analysis, it must be that all of life on earth has come from an unending
    series of cascading chemical reactions. If you can believe that, then you know
    what to do.”\r\n \r\nCent 16 (Cleo rejects Cent, and despite his relentless pursuit
    for the face of God, he begins his descent into madness.)\r\n \r\nChap 18 (Cent
    and Jeshie meet. Cent explains his theory of “facilitated evolution.”)\r\n \r\n“Imagine
    our world, the world you and I and few others inhabit: we sketch an idea in pencil
    or charcoal; we grab a canvas and set it on an easel; we apply the color palette
    to the sides of the canvas—the lime green, turquoise blue, canary yellow, and
    dove white that we want in the final piece…then, do you know what would happen
    next?\r\n…\r\n“You see the beauty in this, Jeshie, the efficiency, the delight.
    What artist—of any genre—wouldn’t like to put some ideas on paper or canvas or
    some few notes to a score of music, only to return later to find the work complete.
    Can you imagine? Quelle surprise!  The shock, the delight, the amazement we would
    feel if we could animate the artistic process, and wait to see what became of
    it?” Here Cent paused to carefully study Jeshie’s face, to ascertain if his colleague
    was comprehending his meaning.\r\n \r\nA moment later, he continued his verbal
    barrage: “I know what you’re thinking: at first it sounds too fabulous to be believed,
    but don’t yet reject my hypothesis…flow with my idea, imagine what great fun we
    as artists would have to set up the outline and color of the composition…” and
    here he paused and took a long draught of fresh coffee… “and come back later to
    find the fait accompli. To animate, in the literal sense of the word, the creative
    process. What would you think of that, Jeshie? Let your mind believe it for a
    moment. Can you see the beauty in it?”\r\n \r\nChap 19 (Jeshie decides to paint
    the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested and has finished it.) Finally, after months
    of exertion, the day arrived when he was nearly finished. He climbed off the ladder,
    slid it to the side, and gazed upon the creation. He breathed deeply, and then
    exhaled. He was pleased. He saw that it was good. Everything was in proportion—balanced,
    meaningful. He had not wasted a stroke, nor needlessly embellished. He had put
    on the wall what had been in his mind. He dropped to his knees and gazing unconsciously
    towards the heavens he offered up a whispered prayer: “Abba, Father, with you
    all things are possible.”\r\n…\r\n(He goes to his room to sleep, mentally and
    physically exhausted.) He napped for hours, and by the time he awoke, it was well
    passed the middle of the night. He brushed his teeth, put on his sleepwear, and
    slid under the covers. This time as he slept, it was not so restful—he tossed
    on cotton waves, and emitted fitful cries.\r\n…\r\nJeshie awoke, in an almost
    somnambulist state, with the dream still playing in his head, and walked down
    to the Academy entranceway. There was a glow from the candles that were still
    lit, which gave the room an eerie and primordial look. Seen through this haze,
    Jeshie looked at the mural, and realized something was wrong. In this light, at
    this time of night, and with subconscious clarity, it was clear that something
    was missing. The mural was too literal, too exact; it seemed to obviate the possibilities
    that must have been ripe at the founding of the world. It was a tribute to natural
    selection, but it seemed hollow and empty, as if the marvel of life could be boiled
    down to a precise definition, when Jeshie knew intuitively, viscerally, that this
    wasn’t so. If life was anything, it was miraculous. This painting stripped it
    of its wonder.\r\n \r\nNatural selection mandates that there is something from
    which to select—but from where did these first entities come? Jeshie didn’t know;
    he didn’t have all the answers. But one thing had always guided him through his
    life, and he needed to pay homage to it here: he needed to show the necessity
    of energy—of vibrations—in the assembling of the universe. Hadn’t Madame Weiss
    affirmed the “cosmic battery,” whether or not this was God?\r\n \r\nWith this
    nugget of an idea in his head, Jeshie returned to bed, fell asleep, and let his
    subconscious mind wrestle with the demons.\r\n \r\nJeshie awoke and went behind
    the curtain for the final time to complete the finishing touches; it was the 4th
    of April. Jeshie took a wash of shimmering translucent silver paint, and above
    the clouds on the top right-hand side of the picture, he painted twelve evenly
    spaced circles, followed by three unevenly spaced ones.\r\n…\r\nAfter months and
    months of fussing over every stroke he was finally done.\r\n \r\nChap 20 (Jeshie’s
    mural is presented, and its “secret” content is revealed when candle light refracts
    off it at just the right angle.)\r\n \r\n“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this
    grand evening that’s a celebration of free thinking and intelligence. A celebration
    of natural selection and rationality.”\r\n \r\nAt this, the Queen cleared her
    throat, perhaps she needed to, or perhaps she was hoping the Dean was not going
    to pontificate half the night. She was curious to see the work, but nothing more.
    And shecertainly didn’t need anyone telling her what to think or how to feel about
    it.\r\n \r\nAt the sound of the queen’s throat clearing, the Dean shortened his
    speech. “Ah, right—a picture is worth a thousand words, and this august body of
    attendees has no need of me to tell them of its importance. So, without further
    ado, I give you, ‘The Ascent of Man.’”\r\n…\r\nAt this time, with the angle of
    the light’s refraction, Jeshie’s riddle could be clearly seen: little translucent
    circles in which was painted FFGA AGFE DDEF FEE. The guests stared for a moment,
    and even the queen was transfixed. Since in attendance were some of the brightest
    minds in Europe, it shouldn’t take long for them to decipher the clue.\r\n…\r\nWith
    that, the first violinist walked up to the Dean. “Excuse me sir, are you still
    trying to solve the riddle?\r\n \r\n“Not now, musician, can’t you see we’re busy
    looking for this scoundrel. Besides, the greatest minds in Europe are here tonight;
    we certainly don’t need a fiddler to solve the puzzle.”\r\n…\r\n“But sir, we’ve
    solved the conundrum. Any musician could so do. Dum, dum, dum, dum (voice rising)…dum,
    dum, dum, dum (voice falling)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice flat)…dummm, dum’, dum’.
    You know it of course, sir: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.”\r\n \r\n“Clever lad,” said
    the Queen.\r\n \r\n“Ingrate,” said the Dean.\r\n \r\n“I understand,” said a nameless
    guest. And he muttered to no one in particular: “With a few simple notes he has
    shown that it is absurd to believe that evolution begat music.”\r\n \r\n(The remainder
    of the book consists of Jeshie and Marie eluding their predators, growing in additional
    knowledge about creation, and then a final resolution.)\nTime: April 28, 2014

<p>It is a pleasure to "meet" someone very literate who is also a believer. I humbly consider myself to be cut from that same cloth. I noticed from your blog that you are starting grad school in the fall. Congrats and best wishes! Before then, I wanted to send you a proposal on a novel I wrote that addresses the evol/creation question in what I think is a provocative and thoughtful (non-preachy) way. If you have time to skim the proposal, I would be very grateful. If you have time to read the book, I would be overjoyed. It is a story that needs to be told. What is the truth? In a nutshell, life can evolve. Few thinking people would deny that. But to overstep the data and claim that all life on Earth evolved is just science-fiction, yet science--uncharacteristically I might add--refuses to stay in its lane and asserts the most outrageous balderdash. It's highly unscientific, yet some of the most prestigious scientists engage in this, when they should know better. As a scientist and a christian I find both sides lacking on this issue. With this book, I am trying to start a dialog that will get both sides to admit what they do and don't know so that non-scientists can get a better focus on the real picture. Can you help?<br />

<p>Chap 6 “You see son, we have wanted to keep this project (the “Ascent of Man” mural to be painted at the Royal Science Academy) a secret, because there are those in England, and on the continent too, who would think it—well, if not exactly inappropriate—at least suspect.” This time it was the director himself who chimed in.  “But we—and by ‘we’ I mean this august body in front of whom you now sit—have decided that after all is said and done, we’d like the project to go in a new direction, to capture some groundbreaking work—(laughing) quite literally—that is just now shedding a whole new light on huge sections of science, work that will set it on its proper pedestal, work so visionary that it should be the touchstone of this whole institute.  The theory of which I’m speaking is none other than the one proposed by that most esteemed discoverer/explorer/intellect….” But the chairman was not able to finish. As he was building to a crescendo there was a sudden knock at the door.</p>
<p>(Jeshie attends the lecture at which Darwin presents “The Origin of Species.”)</p>
<p>Chap 8 (In which Cent’s friend, Opa, tries to make an arrangement between himself and a woman he wants to marry, named Cleo.)</p>
<p>She decided, his personality was probably a mélange of hard work from an early age, parents who were strict disciplinarians, and a cluster of siblings who provided at least some affection and camaraderie. That said, there was still a sorrow and melancholy about him which she couldn’t explain. She hoped this lovely Cleo could bring some light into his austere world.<br />
Chap 9 (Jeshie meets a Newton scholar who helps him understand Newton’s views on God, and how these were reflected in and motivation for many of his discoveries).</p>
<p>Chap 10 (Jeshie meets the “red-eyed man” who tried to convince him of the importance of Darwin’s work, or at the very least, that he should remain neutral about the theory and paint the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested by the Royals Science Academy.)</p>
<p>Chap 11 (Jeshie meets a young girl who will help him on his journey for truth.) One day he was sitting, watching, and eating a pear—his favorite fruit—when a slip of a girl ambled by, lithe and fit, more dancing than walking really, as the care she put in the simple act of placing her feet revealed her natural agility. Jeshie, who hadn’t thought much about these things until this moment, was instantly transfixed.<br />
…<br />
“Oh, let me introduce myself. I’m…” just then a sparrow lit on her shoulder, startling her for a moment, but charming them both—it was such a rare event for such a skittish creature.<br />
…<br />
A moment later, the blissful feeling in their hearts and souls bubbled up to their consciousness, and they were promptly embarrassed, as one standing naked in a shower is immediately chagrined if someone enters unexpectedly, whereas just moments ago they were contented in their nakedness.<br />
…<br />
As nature would have it, one of them had to break the awkwardness that was now thick between them, but just as surely, neither of these brave souls wanted to be the first to blink. Oddly, after sitting a moment, the uneasiness past, and both looked at the sparrow at their feet, and then simultaneously reached for each other’s hand. They sat for some time, just being, listening to the chirps and the wind and the music of nature.<br />
…<br />
(Jeshie has another encounter with the red-eyed man, who again tries to convince him to paint “The Ascent of Man.) Relieved at having made a decision, or at least accepting the one that arose within him, he trotted off to the drawing room to tell Herr Redd the news. Jogging past the west bed of DaVinci’s Garden, he noticed a Brazilian Blue butterfly sitting on a lily. He was curious as to what it would be doing wild in Italy, since that species of Lepidoptera were not found outside of the tropics. Nevertheless, it sat there, indolently beating its gorgeous, shockingly azure, wings. Jeshie twisted his head as he ran past her, somehow wanting to break neither his stride nor his view. Naturally, the two were incompatible, and since he refused to look away from the blue treasure, he tripped and flew a few feet down the walkway before coming back down to earth.</p>
<p>Jeshie—fairly coordinated—fell gently, then slid to an easy stop with just a skinned knee and a cut hand. Still lying on the ground, he looked at his bleeding palm—the splash of red dripping to the ground broke his blue reverie. He hopped up, anxious to compose himself; he brushed off his knee, and wiped his flesh a few times, to remove the blood. When he looked again, the butterfly was gone.<br />
.<br />
Chap 13 (Cent’s commission is finished and revealed to an audience who doesn’t quite understand it but tries to be polite. He feels shunned, as usual, and decides to take a walk out of town by himself, where he encounters the red-eyed man.)</p>
<p>Cent never paid attention to time, but from the height of the moon, he knew it couldn’t be too late. He didn’t want to worry the organizers, nor did he want to try their patience. On his way back into town, he saw a smoldering ember hovering above the ground. As he drew closer, he smelled a hint of Cuban tobacco, rare in Europe, but he knew its scent from a certain Parisian salon he had frequented on his way to Terramo. There was a man, leaning against the barn door, smoking a cigar. Cent caught a glimpse of his face, and noticed that the man’s eyes seemed to have an eerie glow. Cent slowed his pace, in a rare display of curiosity, and waited for the man to speak. The smoker said nothing, but gazed deeply into Cent’s face. There was nothing to say that couldn’t be communicated with the simple smirk he was wearing. Cent tried to pass, but the man threw out his hand and grabbed his shoulder.  Cent felt a sharp pain shoot down his arm, and smelled a hint of seared flesh. Just as quickly, the man released him, and slid into the night.</p>
<p>Cent returned to his straw cot in the little shed behind the church; he sat for some time with his head in his hands and stared at the floor, trying to make sense of all that had transpired. He did not have any luck.</p>
<p>Chap 15 (Jeshie is whisked away to a secret castle where he is given some special training to help him decide how to paint the “Ascent of Man” commission, or if to paint it at all. He meets Madame Curie, who gives him some chemical insights into the nature of life. He is also presented with a two-sided scroll that contains reasons for and against believing in “natural selection.”</p>
<p>Madame Curie: “I’m not one to lecture, Jeshie, but there is one thing I would like to share with you in your search. It is this: Biology is nothing more than chemistry—living chemistry,” here she paused, to see if he would get the meaning of her words.</p>
<p>“So, for natural selection to be true, in the final analysis, it must be that all of life on earth has come from an unending series of cascading chemical reactions. If you can believe that, then you know what to do.”</p>
<p>Cent 16 (Cleo rejects Cent, and despite his relentless pursuit for the face of God, he begins his descent into madness.)</p>
<p>Chap 18 (Cent and Jeshie meet. Cent explains his theory of “facilitated evolution.”)</p>
<p>“Imagine our world, the world you and I and few others inhabit: we sketch an idea in pencil or charcoal; we grab a canvas and set it on an easel; we apply the color palette to the sides of the canvas—the lime green, turquoise blue, canary yellow, and dove white that we want in the final piece…then, do you know what would happen next?<br />
…<br />
“You see the beauty in this, Jeshie, the efficiency, the delight. What artist—of any genre—wouldn’t like to put some ideas on paper or canvas or some few notes to a score of music, only to return later to find the work complete. Can you imagine? Quelle surprise!  The shock, the delight, the amazement we would feel if we could animate the artistic process, and wait to see what became of it?” Here Cent paused to carefully study Jeshie’s face, to ascertain if his colleague was comprehending his meaning.</p>
<p>A moment later, he continued his verbal barrage: “I know what you’re thinking: at first it sounds too fabulous to be believed, but don’t yet reject my hypothesis…flow with my idea, imagine what great fun we as artists would have to set up the outline and color of the composition…” and here he paused and took a long draught of fresh coffee… “and come back later to find the fait accompli. To animate, in the literal sense of the word, the creative process. What would you think of that, Jeshie? Let your mind believe it for a moment. Can you see the beauty in it?”</p>
<p>Chap 19 (Jeshie decides to paint the “Ascent of Man” mural as requested and has finished it.) Finally, after months of exertion, the day arrived when he was nearly finished. He climbed off the ladder, slid it to the side, and gazed upon the creation. He breathed deeply, and then exhaled. He was pleased. He saw that it was good. Everything was in proportion—balanced, meaningful. He had not wasted a stroke, nor needlessly embellished. He had put on the wall what had been in his mind. He dropped to his knees and gazing unconsciously towards the heavens he offered up a whispered prayer: “Abba, Father, with you all things are possible.”<br />
…<br />
(He goes to his room to sleep, mentally and physically exhausted.) He napped for hours, and by the time he awoke, it was well passed the middle of the night. He brushed his teeth, put on his sleepwear, and slid under the covers. This time as he slept, it was not so restful—he tossed on cotton waves, and emitted fitful cries.<br />
…<br />
Jeshie awoke, in an almost somnambulist state, with the dream still playing in his head, and walked down to the Academy entranceway. There was a glow from the candles that were still lit, which gave the room an eerie and primordial look. Seen through this haze, Jeshie looked at the mural, and realized something was wrong. In this light, at this time of night, and with subconscious clarity, it was clear that something was missing. The mural was too literal, too exact; it seemed to obviate the possibilities that must have been ripe at the founding of the world. It was a tribute to natural selection, but it seemed hollow and empty, as if the marvel of life could be boiled down to a precise definition, when Jeshie knew intuitively, viscerally, that this wasn’t so. If life was anything, it was miraculous. This painting stripped it of its wonder.</p>
<p>Natural selection mandates that there is something from which to select—but from where did these first entities come? Jeshie didn’t know; he didn’t have all the answers. But one thing had always guided him through his life, and he needed to pay homage to it here: he needed to show the necessity of energy—of vibrations—in the assembling of the universe. Hadn’t Madame Weiss affirmed the “cosmic battery,” whether or not this was God?</p>
<p>With this nugget of an idea in his head, Jeshie returned to bed, fell asleep, and let his subconscious mind wrestle with the demons.</p>
<p>Jeshie awoke and went behind the curtain for the final time to complete the finishing touches; it was the 4th of April. Jeshie took a wash of shimmering translucent silver paint, and above the clouds on the top right-hand side of the picture, he painted twelve evenly spaced circles, followed by three unevenly spaced ones.<br />
…<br />
After months and months of fussing over every stroke he was finally done.</p>
<p>Chap 20 (Jeshie’s mural is presented, and its “secret” content is revealed when candle light refracts off it at just the right angle.)</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this grand evening that’s a celebration of free thinking and intelligence. A celebration of natural selection and rationality.”</p>
<p>At this, the Queen cleared her throat, perhaps she needed to, or perhaps she was hoping the Dean was not going to pontificate half the night. She was curious to see the work, but nothing more. And shecertainly didn’t need anyone telling her what to think or how to feel about it.</p>
<p>At the sound of the queen’s throat clearing, the Dean shortened his speech. “Ah, right—a picture is worth a thousand words, and this august body of attendees has no need of me to tell them of its importance. So, without further ado, I give you, ‘The Ascent of Man.’”<br />
…<br />
At this time, with the angle of the light’s refraction, Jeshie’s riddle could be clearly seen: little translucent circles in which was painted FFGA AGFE DDEF FEE. The guests stared for a moment, and even the queen was transfixed. Since in attendance were some of the brightest minds in Europe, it shouldn’t take long for them to decipher the clue.<br />
…<br />
With that, the first violinist walked up to the Dean. “Excuse me sir, are you still trying to solve the riddle?</p>
<p>“Not now, musician, can’t you see we’re busy looking for this scoundrel. Besides, the greatest minds in Europe are here tonight; we certainly don’t need a fiddler to solve the puzzle.”<br />
…<br />
“But sir, we’ve solved the conundrum. Any musician could so do. Dum, dum, dum, dum (voice rising)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice falling)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice flat)…dummm, dum’, dum’. You know it of course, sir: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.”</p>
<p>“Clever lad,” said the Queen.</p>
<p>“Ingrate,” said the Dean.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said a nameless guest. And he muttered to no one in particular: “With a few simple notes he has shown that it is absurd to believe that evolution begat music.”</p>
<p>(The remainder of the book consists of Jeshie and Marie eluding their predators, growing in additional knowledge about creation, and then a final resolution.)<br />

    [Comment] =&gt; It is a pleasure to "meet" someone very literate who is also a believer. I humbly consider myself to be cut from that same cloth. I noticed from your blog that you are starting grad school in the fall. Congrats and best wishes! Before then, I wanted to send you a proposal on a novel I wrote that addresses the evol/creation question in what I think is a provocative and thoughtful (non-preachy) way. If you have time to skim the proposal, I would be very grateful. If you have time to read the book, I would be overjoyed. It is a story that needs to be told. What is the truth? In a nutshell, life can evolve. Few thinking people would deny that. But to overstep the data and claim that all life on Earth evolved is just science-fiction, yet science--uncharacteristically I might add--refuses to stay in its lane and asserts the most outrageous balderdash. It's highly unscientific, yet some of the most prestigious scientists engage in this, when they should know better. As a scientist and a christian I find both sides lacking on this issue. With this book, I am trying to start a dialog that will get both sides to admit what they do and don't know so that non-scientists can get a better focus on the real picture. Can you help?<br />

Author Biography:<br />
Author holds a Ph.D. in Physiology from University of Cincinnati, and currently teaches same at an Ohio college. Thus, she has a solid background in life science, and an academic understanding of the precise strengths and weaknesses of “natural selection” and evolution. She is a Christian. This unique intersection of spiritual and science worlds has allowed her to gain specific insights that she weaves into this novel. Her sphere of influence/platform would be her school and other like-minded scientists and Christians who are eager to know the truth of how these two worlds mesh.</p>
<p>Hook: Is it Chance or is it a God? Make this beautiful and masterfully written fiction your own journey to answering the age-old existential question of how we and the biosphere arrived here. When Cent and Jeshie, two young, very different but equally talented artists are tasked with painting murals, they depart on a journey that forces them to confront their beliefs about life, art, and the meaning of "creation." They are thrown into a mysterious and exciting whirlwind of culture, science, history, and love—a thrilling, provocative, cerebral adventure that will challenge your belief structures, and at its end, leave you satisfied that you took the ride.</p>
<p>Overview: Do you believe in evolution or creation? On the one hand, it is hard to believe that a supernatural being hand made every last thing on our planet, down to mosquitoes or the tetanus bacteria; on the other hand, few of us have witnessed the birth of our children, felt the magical, inexpressible joy and wonder of new life entering the world, and wanted to exclaim, “Look what evolution has begot”! This is why many people believe and feel that there is a bit of truth on both sides of this often divisive issue. While there are those who straddle the fence, there are also extremists on both sides who are so entrenched in their position that often rational, clear-headed discussion on the topic seems to get obviated by name calling and mudslinging. </p>
<p>JCEG is the story of two artists who seek “beauty in truth” and the face of God through their commissions. It weaves a complex tales in which one character—pious and disciplined—spends his righteous life trying to find a God who won’t speak to him while the other character—often cavalier and doubtful—finds God in spite of himself. If also tackles the multi-faceted question of what it means to be a creator in any field, and how a novel notion about creation might help to explain the role that “natural selection” would play in the work of a whimsical, ever changing God.</p>
<p>Audience: This book is written for anyone who is still trying to answer the question: How did we get here? It is written for the 32% of Americans (about 100 million people) who are categorized as believing in “theistic evolution” (evolution aided or facilitated by a divine being). The book does NOT preach one message or another, but tenderly crafts a story in which readers can find their own truth.<br />

Sample Chapter/s<br />
Note: All work is excerpted from chapters unless enclosed in (*)</p>
<p>Chap 2: Jeshie grew in mind and spirit, as well as talent, and it didn’t take long before he outgrew these childhood scribbles; all of central Italy was talking about his talent. He was soon tapped for formal training and tutelage. Although Jeshie was a lovely boy of average birth (some might call him poor), his abilities opened the most famous doors in Italy—fearlessly, he walked right though.<br />
…<br />
He was charming and outgoing—surprisingly poised and well-spoken for one of such few years. He had the manner of a great statesman even at his tender age; in years gone by people would stop and wonder what kind of childhood could have shaped such a stellar specimen. Then his elders would laugh and shake their heads, saying only, “As a child, he was shorter.”</p>
<p>Chap 3: Just across the northern border of France, an equally impressive young artist was developing—unloved and misshapen—into a powerful, pitiable force. His frail mind and body housed a ferocious talent, who—like a weed growing from under a sidewalk—struggled toward the light.<br />
…<br />
This young child, whom everyone called Cent, was neutral looking and untalkative. He was forceful—far, far beyond his years. He didn’t laugh or play or rabble-rouse as other boys…he lived life with the intensity of a Mayfly, thinking only of how to reproduce himself intellectually, artistically, or spiritually, before his end would come.<br />
…<br />
Barns and straw make for sporadic sleep, and many was the night that Cent stayed awake for hours—shivering in the cold, or itching in the straw. He would pass his time in prayer, never in pity or questions, but simply asking God to make use of him. During one of these nights, where he was as much mumbling to himself as communing with a higher power, an odd thing happened. Sometime during these musings, Cent heard a creak, a snap, and then several chunks of beautiful cherry wood fell in a jumble in front of him. Whether it was the hallucinations of sleeplessness, the necessity of probability, or the actuality of Divine Intervention, the pieces were composed of the exact size and shape, and were juxtaposed in such a way—at least in Cent’s mind—as to suggest the Christ child in the manger scene. Even more bizarre, when Cent looked up on the ledge, he saw a carving knife that he swore had not been there before.<br />
…<br />
Cent was entranced by this story (Daniel, Chap 8) and strengthened by the fact that God could and did indeed foretell the future, at least when it suited Him. It was true that Alexander united the then city-states of Greece into a true kingdom, becoming its first king; it was true that he crossed an unfathomable expanse of the world at such a pace, it appeared that he was “crossing the whole earth without touching the ground; it was true that he was “broken off” at the height of his power (age 33); it was true that his kingdom did not pass to his as yet unborn son, Alexander IV, or his half-brother, Philip, but to four of his squabbling generals (which broke the empire into the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Seleucid, the Pergamon, and the Macedon). So on every count that Daniel recorded, (200 years before Alexander was born), God seemed to be right.</p>
<p>Chap 5 (Jeshie and Cent each receive their commission)</p>
<p>Chap 6 “You see son, we have wanted to keep this project (the “Ascent of Man” mural to be painted at the Royal Science Academy) a secret, because there are those in England, and on the continent too, who would think it—well, if not exactly inappropriate—at least suspect.” This time it was the director himself who chimed in.  “But we—and by ‘we’ I mean this august body in front of whom you now sit—have decided that after all is said and done, we’d like the project to go in a new direction, to capture some groundbreaking work—(laughing) quite literally—that is just now shedding a whole new light on huge sections of science, work that will set it on its proper pedestal, work so visionary that it should be the touchstone of this whole institute.  The theory of which I’m speaking is none other than the one proposed by that most esteemed discoverer/explorer/intellect….” But the chairman was not able to finish. As he was building to a crescendo there was a sudden knock at the door.</p>
<p>(Jeshie attends the lecture at which Darwin presents “The Origin of Species.”)</p>
<p>Chap 8 (In which Cent’s friend, Opa, tries to make an arrangement between himself and a woman he wants to marry, named Cleo.)</p>
<p>She decided, his personality was probably a mélange of hard work from an early age, parents who were strict disciplinarians, and a cluster of siblings who provided at least some affection and camaraderie. That said, there was still a sorrow and melancholy about him which she couldn’t explain. She hoped this lovely Cleo could bring some light into his austere world.<br />
Chap 9 (Jeshie meets a Newton scholar who helps him understand Newton’s views on God, and how these were reflected in and motivation for many of his discoveries).</p>

But one thing had always guided him through his life, and he needed to pay homage to it here: he needed to show the necessity of energy—of vibrations—in the assembling of the universe. Hadn’t Madame Weiss affirmed the “cosmic battery,” whether or not this was God?</p>
<p>With this nugget of an idea in his head, Jeshie returned to bed, fell asleep, and let his subconscious mind wrestle with the demons.</p>
<p>Jeshie awoke and went behind the curtain for the final time to complete the finishing touches; it was the 4th of April. Jeshie took a wash of shimmering translucent silver paint, and above the clouds on the top right-hand side of the picture, he painted twelve evenly spaced circles, followed by three unevenly spaced ones.<br />
…<br />
After months and months of fussing over every stroke he was finally done.</p>
<p>Chap 20 (Jeshie’s mural is presented, and its “secret” content is revealed when candle light refracts off it at just the right angle.)</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this grand evening that’s a celebration of free thinking and intelligence. A celebration of natural selection and rationality.”</p>
<p>At this, the Queen cleared her throat, perhaps she needed to, or perhaps she was hoping the Dean was not going to pontificate half the night. She was curious to see the work, but nothing more. And shecertainly didn’t need anyone telling her what to think or how to feel about it.</p>
<p>At the sound of the queen’s throat clearing, the Dean shortened his speech. “Ah, right—a picture is worth a thousand words, and this august body of attendees has no need of me to tell them of its importance. So, without further ado, I give you, ‘The Ascent of Man.’”<br />
…<br />
At this time, with the angle of the light’s refraction, Jeshie’s riddle could be clearly seen: little translucent circles in which was painted FFGA AGFE DDEF FEE. The guests stared for a moment, and even the queen was transfixed. Since in attendance were some of the brightest minds in Europe, it shouldn’t take long for them to decipher the clue.<br />
…<br />
With that, the first violinist walked up to the Dean. “Excuse me sir, are you still trying to solve the riddle?</p>
<p>“Not now, musician, can’t you see we’re busy looking for this scoundrel. Besides, the greatest minds in Europe are here tonight; we certainly don’t need a fiddler to solve the puzzle.”<br />
…<br />
“But sir, we’ve solved the conundrum. Any musician could so do. Dum, dum, dum, dum (voice rising)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice falling)…dum, dum, dum, dum (voice flat)…dummm, dum’, dum’. You know it of course, sir: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.”</p>
<p>“Clever lad,” said the Queen.</p>
<p>“Ingrate,” said the Dean.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said a nameless guest. And he muttered to no one in particular: “With a few simple notes he has shown that it is absurd to believe that evolution begat music.”</p>
<p>(The remainder of the book consists of Jeshie and Marie eluding their predators, growing in additional knowledge about creation, and then a final resolution.)<br />
