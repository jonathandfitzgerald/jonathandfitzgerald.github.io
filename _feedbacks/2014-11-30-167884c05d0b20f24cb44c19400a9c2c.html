    Jonathan:\r\n\r\nI recently read what you wrote regarding Tim Keller and the Redeemer
    Pres-byterian movement.' I was intensely involved with it many years ago -- and
    then, felt total dis-enchantment with it, when, the Village Church closed down
    -- and I had poured two years of my life -- ending up in the hospitals several
    times, with panic attacks, with an arts-center, in which Mako Fujimura, and others,
    including Tim Keller -- took my proposal, and have left me out of the picture,
    and in a lurch. I am presently a Medicaid patient -- and helped the Redeemer movement
    plant two churches; and yet, my father, who just celebrated his 90th birthday
    -- was t-e first chinese graduate of Westminster Seminary, and planted a Christian
    Reformed church in NYC many years ago. 'We,' essentialy brought the PCA into NYC
    -- and yet, they have not supported us, nor helped us at all. In fact, our church
    closed down, and there is a PCA church using our facility -- but the pastor, hasn't
    even visited my father all these years. It seems that the 'star quality' and stage-set
    of Redeemer, has colored the entire PCA -- and Tim's ambitions with his Gospel
    Coalition, and his personal ambitions. I would love to talk to you more about
    your experience, as too many people have suffered, and it is difficult to address
    the non-accountability within the churches, which now also, is reflected in both
    our domestic and international 'non-public' theology -- and our country has become
    a disgrace to the world at large.  \r\n\r\nI am a gradute of the Juilliard School,
    Westminster Seminary, Columbia University,  Queens College (CUNY). I have taught
    at Calvin College; Columbia University; The Pratt Institute; Rhode Island School
    of Design;  and the Cooper Union. I, also, have been involved a critic and lectured
    at Harvard; University of Melbourne, Australia; Yale University; City College;
    New Jersey Institute of Technology; New York Institute of Technology; The City
    College of NYC; CUNY Grad Center; University of Michigan; Tshinghua University;
    Beijing Normal University; Beiwai University of Foreign Languages; University
    of Cincinatti; Central Arts Academy,  in Beijing.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, that,
    I gave Tim Keller, my arts proposal, but, he has never invited me to speak --
    nor has Mako Fujimura., whom, I housed while I started the Jubilee Arts Centre,
    which housed Mako's IAM. At the same time, none of the PCA churches has invited
    me to speak, and, I helped them plant two churches: 1) one the Village Church;
    2) Emmanuel Presbyterian, which meets at Columbia.\r\n\r\nI too, joined the Episcopal
    Church, but, have run into problems there too -- of racism, and neo-con elements,
    in which I do post-colonial theology, justice and race.  I would love to share
    with you more, and would like to hear more from you, myself.\r\n\r\nHumbly,\r\n\r\nJohn
