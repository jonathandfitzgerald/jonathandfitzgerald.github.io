    Jonathon (Mr. Fitzgerald? The proper format of a comment section was never covered
    in my English classes),\r\n\r\nI'm Sara, an American expat living in the Netherlands
    studying to become a high school English teacher here. In one of my courses, the
    college is giving future teachers like me (most of whom are Dutch) a crash course
    in American history and culture. Our final product of the course is to create
    a short lesson on a given topic (chosen from a list). Most of our choices are
    decidedly elementary for a person who has already been through the American school
    system (Civil War, Civil Rights, American Indians, The Great Depression, etc.).
    \ I've decided to choose an honors topic instead, American Sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThe
    materials we are given to research this topic are Christy Wampole's New York Times
    piece, \"How to Live Without Irony,\" your response piece \"Sincerity, Not Irony,
    Is Our Age's Ethos\" and the talk radio interview of you both on the show On Point
    at WBUR. After listening to the interview and reading both pieces, I'm very much
    inclined to agree with you, that my generation (born in 1988) is much more sincere
    than we might appear to members of other generations. However throughout the interview,
    I realized that a lot has happened since 2012 (the mainstreaming of feminism,
    the Sony hack, ISIS) and was wondering if you had any insight into how the use
    of irony/sincerity has changed in the last three years.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think
    that Dr. Wampole has trouble taking young people seriously because of her experiences
    in the 90s when many young people were very rarely sincere. As a result, she is
    unable to recognize sincerity in my generation and uses anecdotal and vague examples
    to reinforce her own beliefs.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading and I hope
    to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely (and I do mean sincerely ;))\r\n\r\nSara
