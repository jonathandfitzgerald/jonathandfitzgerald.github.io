    \nComment: Hi, my name is Tacita and I am a recent graduate from the MRes programme
    of the London Consortium,  University of London.\r\n\r\n I am currently writing
    an article on  The New Sincerity VS.  Irony debate and, having read your book
    \"Not Your Mother’s Morals: How the New Sincerity Is Changing Pop Culture for
    the Better\", I was hoping I could  get your answers to a couple of questions.
    \r\n\r\nIn particular,  given the possibility of irony leading to \"a sinkhole
    of relativism and disavowal\", do you think irony is degrading contemporary culture?
    Why and how?\r\n\r\nRegarding the  earnest backlash of New Sincerity,  do you
    believe it has eroded irony? To which extent and what are the consequences? \r\n\r\nDo
    you believe there is the possibility for this  ‘authenticity’ to be commoditised?
    How? \r\n\r\n I would truly value to be able to quote you regarding these points:
    I appreciate you may not have the time to answer exhaustively or think about each
    question, but any answer I can get is valuable to me. \r\n\r\nHoping to hear from
    you, please receive by best regards, \r\n\r\nTacita Vero'\nTime: July 28, 2014
