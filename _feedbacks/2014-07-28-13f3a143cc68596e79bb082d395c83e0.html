    \nComment: What exactly did you teach as an adjunct faculty member at Gordon College
    and do you have a reference?\r\n\r\nI am sure you consider yourself a Christian
    along with the majority (largest group) of the country and the world.  If you
    ever had Marvin Wilson as a professor you may have heard him say there was always
    an Israel within Israel just as there are Christians within Christianity.\r\n\r\nYou
    are worse than a non-believer and I fear for you.  You are on terrifying ground
    brother and I would be remiss if I didn't care enough to say how wrong you are.
    \ Love is inclusive for sure but, \"If you love me, you will keep my commandments.\"
    John 14:15\r\n\r\nYou may fee comfortable challenging the commandments based on
    our current historical/cultural context under a progressive belief that humanity
    has evolved for the better.  However, is betting on it with your eternity worth
    the gamble in exchange for voice welcomes by the world?\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nMatt Manella\r\nGordon
