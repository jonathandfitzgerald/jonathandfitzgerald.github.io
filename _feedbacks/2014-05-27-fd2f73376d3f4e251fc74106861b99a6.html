    omar@ashmaweyfilms.com\nWebsite: www.ashmaweyfilms.com\nComment: Hello Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\n\r\nMy
    name is Omar Ashmawey and I’m an independent film producer. \r\n\r\nFirst and
    foremost, I'd like to tell you that I absolutely loved \"Not Your Mother's Morals.\"
    :) I found it to be very compelling and a fresh take on the concept of morality
    in our generation. \r\n\r\nGiven your experience and expertise, I’m contacting
    you in particular to get your advice on our latest feature length film, Boiling
    Pot. This independent film stars Danielle Fishel (Boy Meets World), Oscar-winner
    Lou Gossett Jr, Emmy Award-winner Keith David, Emmet Walsh (Bladerunner), John
    Heard (Home Alone), and Davetta Sherwood (The Young & The Restless). \r\n\r\nThe
    film is based on true events and tells the story of racism on a college campus
    during the 2008 Presidential election. The plot is centered around modern day
    racism with a great grassroots campaign and Danielle Fishel in her first serious
    role in a drama. We’re JUST about to hit the festival circuit and are looking
    for the right fits. \r\n\r\nI’ve been hearing that not every festival is right
    for every film, and vice versa. Given that you’re the Executive Director for the
    HFF, I wanted to get your opinion on whether or our film (albeit somewhat controversial
    and of a heavy subject matter) would be appropriate for this kind of festival.
    \r\n\r\nIs there a specific theme this year? I understand that Cinecause is now
    looking for more \"social-impact\" cinema so I would think that Boiling Pot would
    fall under this category. However, this is our first year at festivals for a full
    length feature and we’re still learning the ropes. So any advice you may have
    or any guidance would be most appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\nPS.
    I've also emailed you this same  message in hopes to reach you. Thanks again for
    your time. \r\n\r\nOmar Ashmawey\nTime: May 27, 2014 at 2:55 pm\nIP Address: 207.38.23.45\nContact
