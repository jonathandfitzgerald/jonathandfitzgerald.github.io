    in Essex  Mass.  We have 4 children, Leah 19, who survived a major car crash in
    2012, hopeless, faithless, and self medicating at 14-17.  After her crash(which
    split a telephone pole in half, landing on her car) she survived, not injured
    or injuring anyone else.  She was locked up in Brockton for 8 notes.  On the 8th
    nite www.straightaheadministries(originating from Gordon seminary 19 yrs ago,
    had some one slip under Leah's door\"A way Out'  that was a little book of teenagers
    stories of anger, hurt, crime, broken, hopeless.  In their brokeness, they took
    the outreach of God's hand/heart and she responded on her knees to Jeremiah 29:11.
    \ She just returned from a Christian Orphanage in Haiti(3 times this year)  she
    got her GED at 16, made dean's list at Northshore Community College(at her worst
    ) and now after God's intervention, a Hope, a purpose(rehab two years ago this
    summer) she is applying for Nursing school.  We are hoping to go visit the Gloucester
    Community Church for the first time and saw you are playing there in August.  Do
    you ever tutor talented, with great potential aspiring writers/  She, and our
    son Jake, who was a sick kid for 11 years(a compromised immune system) in and
    out of Children's Hospital, like the John Travolta movie \"The boy in the Plastic
    Bubble\"  now both of them have read(as well as ourselves some of your writing's.
    \ At best, to met you and be able to ask questions would be profoundly inspiring!!
    \   Thankyou,  John and Joanne Sheridan.  Josh is 10, a wise owl and  Johnny is
    seven and writes and sings songs about God and feeling's!  You Inspire us!!\";}"
