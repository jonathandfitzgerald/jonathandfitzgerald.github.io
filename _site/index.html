			</h2> <p>There was a time when I thought the internet could save us all. It was probably somewhere in the middle of the 2000s. There was a sense then, as Web 2.0 emerged, that the great democratization of data had finally arrived and that by nature of everything being open and shareable and social and free, many of the problems we’d been saddled with because of traditional media would suddenly disappear.</p>

			</h2> <p>In recent months, a number of writers and photographers have begun to utilize Instagram beyond its common use as an application that enables the creation, stylizing, and sharing of personal photographs to a particular group of friends and acquaintances, and rather as a journalistic tool. In particular, writers like Jeff Sharlet and photographers like Neil Shea have paired their photos with short narratives, constrained to 2200 characters by Instagram’s caption limit. The effect is similar to that of “Flash Fiction”—short, impactful self-contained stories—except that these stories are true and paired with a photograph of the subject.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/11/06/graphing-with-gephi.html">Graphing with Gephi</a>
			</h2> <p>[gview file="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Facebook.pdf"]</p>
<p>The above PDF is a visual representation of my Facebook network. I completed this just after class last week as my first experiment with Gephi in an effort, simply, to get some data into the software and see what I could do with it. But, creating this graph had an additional benefit of showing me, in a way that I was having trouble imagining, the ways in which being able to graph a network can make things that may have been hidden, visible.</p>
<p>In looking at the Facebook graph, for example, I was particularly interested in the outliers. There is a mass in the middle that represents my connections from college, many of which do in fact remain the most central in my life. But then, there are several adjacent networks that accurately mark different periods in my life—high school, for example, or my MA program, or the years I lived in Jersey City. Additionally, there are some smaller groups, or even single nodes, that each tell a story. I was particularly amused to find a distant connection, linked only through one friend, that reminded me of the disastrous weekend that my best friend visited with a new (and short lived) girlfriend. And yet, there she is, hanging precariously from the outer reaches of my network, connected by one thin edge.</p>
<p>But though I found the Facebook graph helpful in getting to know Gephi, I knew that in order to fully immerse myself, I need to begin with data that I generated, import it, and go from there—in short, I needed to start from scratch.</p>
<p>I spent a few days thinking about what might be valuable to visualize, and, particularly, I was thinking about how graphing might serve my final project. To that end, I imagined a graph that might show where the various contributors to The Paper, college students when they wrote, ended up publishing after college. Did they continue in the same vein of literary journalism? Did they continue in journalism at all? I still am interested in seeing this, but I have to wait until I have access to the data.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I decided to try to accomplish something similar, using data I have available. For this, I turned to a couple of anthologies of literary journalism, <i>The Art of Fact</i> and <i>Literary Journalism.</i> I added each writer from both anthologies, as well as the name and date of the pieces that are collected. That was the easy part. From their, I turned to the “Permissions” section of each book and tried to determine where each piece was originally published. My sense was that, in doing this, I would be able to easily see which publications published the most literary journalism from the mid-twentieth century through today.</p>
<p>What I didn’t anticipate, particularly in the case of those selections from <i>The Art of Fact,</i> is that most permissions referred to books by the author as opposed to periodicals. My sense is that, even in many of these instances, the piece was originally published in a periodical before being collected into a collection of the author’s work, but I didn’t attempt to prove that for this exercise.</p>
<p>Instead, what you see below, is a graph of mostly disconnected nodes. That is, with the exception of a few periodicals—The New Yorker and Esquire are the most notable—the relationships exist only between a single author and a single periodical or book. Ultimately, this doesn’t make for a very interesting graph, but it did prove an important exercise in that it helped me understand the opportunities, as well as the limitations, of graphing, and how both of those really depend on the data I’m working with.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/11/04/pragmatic-tinkering-or-against-truthiness.html">Pragmatic Tinkering, or Against Truthiness</a>
			</h2> <p>On October 17, 2005, the world was reintroduced to Stephen Colbert, who had previously been a correspondent on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” via his own show, “The Colbert Report.” But, that evening the world was also introduced to a word that would go on to be named “Word of the Year” by the American Dialect Society and Merriam-Webster, “<a href="http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/63ite2/the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a>.” Colbert used the term to highlight a distinction between “those who think with their heads and those who know with their hearts.”</p>
<p>As an example of truthiness, Colbert pointed to President George W. Bush’s nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court as a result of, according to Bush, knowing Miers’ heart. By way of further explanation, Colbert considered the war in Iraq, “If you think about it, maybe there are a few missing pieces to the rational for war, but doesn’t taking Saddam out feel like the right thing, right here in the gut?” He continued, “Because that’s where the truth comes from…the gut.”</p>
<p>Colbert’s use of the word truthiness seems to me a perfect delineation of the perceived conflict between theory and practice. Theory is the kind of thing that one finds in books, which Colbert doesn’t trust; books are elitist, he says.</p>
<p>But, of course, even this idea of making decisions based on “the gut” operates on a kind of theory. And I don’t know that there’s a better name for this theory than truthiness. The fact that even those who imagine they act apart from theory are in fact utilizing a kind of theory was the topic of a previous blog <a href="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/theory-vs-practice-or-the-practice-of-theory/">post</a> in which I considered the imagined conflict between theory and practice through the lens of two distinct, yet related, fields of scholarship, ecocriticism and digital humanities. There, I concluded that setting theory and practice at odds with each other is essentially setting up a false dichotomy. There is no practice without theory. In short, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are always already theorizing.</p>
<p>But as I thought further about this post, it occurred to me that I might be privileging practice over theory by reducing theory to something that is always <i>just</i> present. Of course, theory is more than present. Theory is (or should be) the catalyst for practice. In this essay I’ll move beyond the notion that we can’t escape theory to see why we shouldn’t ever want to.</p>
<p>N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman, in their introduction to the book they co-edited, <a href="http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/comparative-textual-media"><i>Comparative Textual Media: Transforming the Humanities in the Postprint Era</i></a>, provide an excellent frame for this discussion. They write, “Without theorizing, practice can be reduced to technical skills and seamless interpolation into capitalist regimes; without practice, theorizing is deprived of the hands-on experience to guide it and develop robust intuitions about the implications of digital technologies.”</p>
<p>Of course many writers have advocated for the close relationship of theory and practice, but in light of a discussion of the digital humanities—my primary focus here—Hayles and Pressman deftly illustrate in just one sentence why DH has the potential to model this reciprocal relationship.</p>
<p>I want to begin by unpacking the above quote before describing a model for what the integration of theory and practice could look like, something I’m calling “pragmatic tinkering.”</p>
<p>“Without theorizing,” Hayles and Pressman write, “practice can be reduced to technical skills and seamless interpolation into capitalist regimes.” Obviously, in DH technical skills are highly valued, if not fundamental to the work at hand. This semester, I’ve been learning to work with the various tools employed by practitioners of DH—among them, encoding, topic modeling, mapping, creating information visualizations, and networking. Though I consider myself fairly adept at learning and using new technologies, each of these new tools has required a great deal of patience and practice. In a blog <a href="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/messing-around-with-tei/">post</a> in which I reflected on my experience with TEI encoding, for example, I note how, though I’ve been coding HTML and CSS for over a decade, there was still a sharp learning curve when it came to becoming conversant in TEI.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Hayles and Pressman do not mean to downplay the importance of technical skills, but rather to insist that they are not an end in themselves. This, too, has become evident as I’ve been attempting to learn common DH tools. Each lab exercise that I’ve engaged in presents the same problem in getting started: I have to figure out what I want to encode, map, or visualize. Without a sense of what I’m trying to represent, or a hypothesis that I’m employing the tools to prove, the tools are useless.</p>
<p>Perhaps this point is obvious, but what is less so is the way that practice is reduced to “seamless interpolation into capitalist regimes.” Here, I understand Hayles and Pressman as arguing against what we might call “making for making’s sake,” playing, if it’s not extremely obvious, off the phrase “art for art’s sake.” I’ve never been a fan of artists who claim to create art for art’s sake, or, at the very least, I’ve always been skeptical. Here, however, Hayles and Pressman take it a step further in suggesting that making for making’s sake is “seamless interpolation into capitalist regimes.” That is, capitalism wants makers to make ever more things and to pour them into the market to increase competition, etc.</p>
<p>It seems to me that perhaps the mobile phone market is a good example of this kind of making, and it is a market that I’m very much invested in and thus I feel comfortable critiquing. Many people have noticed that smartphone manufacturers—and perhaps my preference, Apple, is among the most blatant offenders here—release small incremental updates to their hardware and software in an effort to insure that users feel the need to upgrade. A new iPhone, for example, is released every year with at least one innovative feature that users <i>just have to have</i>. Again, I can speak to this because I’ve bought five new iPhones in as many years.</p>
<p>If practitioners of DH simply make things to make them, free of any theoretical underpinning or stated purpose, we are playing right into the hands of capitalist regimes that require more things, and care little if those things are theorized or not—or, to put it more plainly, if those things are necessary and useful or not.</p>
<p>But the inverse of practice without theory, Hayles and Pressman tell us, is that without practice, “theorizing is deprived of the hands-on experience to guide it and develop robust intuitions about the implications of digital technologies.” If under-theorized making is typically the domain of the market, theorizing without practice, theorizing for theorizing’s sake, is often seen as a mark of academia. Reading academic articles can sometimes feel like an exercise in wordplay or mind games. We’ve all finished a dense essay in a scholarly journal and thought, <i>so what?</i></p>
<p>In recent years, and in part as a response to this kind of empty theorizing, literary criticism in particular has taken an activist turn. This is seen clearly in much of the work of digital humanists—and is perhaps indicative of the huge emphasis on making in DH—but other fields, including ecocriticism, which I mentioned above, share this activist bent. We want our theorizing to mean something.</p>
<p>For some scholars in the twentieth-century, this activism could be accomplished through theorizing. Much postmodern literary theory, including deconstruction and the hermeneutics of suspicion, which sought to plumb hidden meaning from deep within a text, operated on the assumption that “If everything were transparent, then no ideology would be possible, and no domination either,” as Fredric Jameson wrote in <a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100418630"><i>The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act</i></a><i>, </i>published in 1981.</p>
<p>But, it turns out, it is precisely these techniques that have been most criticized for being overly theoretical without any practical implications. To this end, recent theoretical frameworks have sought to integrate practice into the work of theorizing; so-called “Surface Reading” or its cousin “Distant Reading” are among these.</p>
<p>In their landmark 2009 essay “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/rep.2009.108.1.1?uid=3739696&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21105121664493">Surface Reading: An Introduction,</a>” Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus identify the need for a new kind of theorizing, “Where it had become common for literary scholars to equate their work with political activism, the disasters and triumphs of the last decade have shown that literary criticism alone is not sufficient to effect change.” Best and Marcus propose surface reading, which embraces new media with an aim to “create new forms of knowledge” and “bypass the selectivity and evaluative energy that have been considered the hallmarks of good criticism,” all in an effort to “attain what has almost become taboo in literary studies: objectivity, validity, truth.”</p>
<p>Best and Marcus, and indeed a great number of literary critics, are not attempting to throw out theory because “literary criticism alone is not sufficient to effect change,” but rather to imagine a kind of theorizing that necessarily includes practice. And, it is no surprise that in their effort to do so they must consider the significant role that computers—or, DH—will play in this theory/practice hybrid.</p>
<p>But what might this look like? There is a great deal of talk within DH circles about the value of trial and error—what Jentery Sayers calls “<a href="http://ccdigitalpress.org/cad/Ch10_Sayers.pdf">tinkering</a>” and Stephen Ramsay calls “<a href="http://www.playingwithhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/hermeneutics.pdf">screwing around</a>.” While I’m sure that both Sayers and Ramsay value theory—in fact they are both theorizing in their calls for tinkering/screwing around—the emphasis on practice may have the effect of obscuring the role that theory plays in this endeavor. With that in mind, I’m suggesting we add a descriptive modifier to tinkering: pragmatic. That is, pragmatic tinkering necessarily calls to mind the theorizing that must go into tinkering. (I might have suggested pragmatic screwing around, but I worry that may be misconstrued.)</p>
<p>While the word pragmatic may be read as anti-theory, as in Merriam-Webster’s <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pragmatic">definition</a>: “dealing with the problems that exist in a specific situation in a reasonable and logical way instead of depending on ideas and theories,” my use is meant to recall <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/pragmatism">pragmatism</a> in philosophy, as in “An approach that assesses the truth of meaning of theories or beliefs in terms of the success of their practical application.” In this definition, pragmatic tinkering positions tinkering as corresponding to theorizing—proving or disproving theories, rather than negating them.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m under no illusion that this is necessarily original thought, and indeed, as I stated above, those like Sayers and Ramsay who advocate for tinkering are sure to have in mind theoretical underpinnings, but in an environment wherein a perceived discord between “hacking” and “yacking” exists, it seems never inappropriate to remind those of us starting out in DH that we can’t have one without the other, nor should we desire to. In fact, pragmatic tinkering needn't describe only our practice, but as we young scholars begin to the lay the foundation for the rest our careers, we can tinker too with theories—testing them here, applying them there, in an effort to see which best serve our work.</p>
<p>Unless we aspire to be purveyors of Stephen Colbert’s “truthiness,” doing our work based simply on a feeling in our guts, we should strive to always integrate theory into our practice. Working this way is not particularly cavalier, but at least we can be sure we won’t lead anyone into war based simply on a feeling in our guts.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/10/23/the-myth-of-maps.html">The Myth of Maps</a>
			</h2> <p>Here’s a safe assumption: most people in the Western world believe in at least one pervasive, life-defining myth. This myth underlies our daily lives. Where we live and work, who we associate with, and how we define ourselves are shaped by this myth. I could very well be talking about religion, and certainly life in the United States is predicated on certain religious beliefs, but there are those who deny those beliefs and actively work against them. The myth I’m describing, dare I say, is even bigger than religion, and not as easily denied. I’m talking about the myth of maps.</p>
<p>A paradigm shift occurred in the early modern period with regards to maps. In his <a href="http://ww.friedrichdurrenmatt.net/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter1.pdf">essay</a> “Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change,” David Woodward described it thusly, “by creating maps people saw, perhaps for the first time, that they could influence events and create worlds, that they could have the freedom to do things, rather than accept passively whatever God had ordained.” Though there had been maps long before the early modern period, they lacked the authority we recognize today. That is, until “the inclusion of a formal legend or map key that makes explicit the relationship between a sign and what it signifies,” as Woodward describes it.</p>
<p>Dennis Wood, in an <a href="http://www.cartographicperspectives.org/carto/index.php/journal/article/view/cp56-wood">essay</a> titled “A Map Is an Image Proclaiming Its Objective Neutrality,” refers to this formal legend as “the mask no map goes without,” and it is meant to denote trustworthiness. We know we are looking at a map when we see these formalities, and we implicitly trust that the map is an accurate representation of real places. We accept the mask. Wood goes on to write, “Any discourse proclaiming its own trustworthiness is alienated discourse, what Roland Barthes called myth.”</p>
<p>So maps are the myth we all believe. But as Woodward points out, maps are created by people who, rather than simply reporting what is there, “influence and create worlds.” Maps, rather than being objective representations are subjective when they wear the mask that encourages us to believe in them. “It was with the presentational code that the map insisted on being accepted not as a discourse about the world (which would be open to discussion, or a fight) but as the world itself (about which we could do nothing, which we could only accept), this is to say, as myth,” Wood writes.</p>
<p>I grant that this is difficult to accept at first. Of course maps are created by people, we might say, but they are people whose interest is in truthfully representing what is. But if we consider maps a bit further, we can’t help but see the myth. See, for example, the case of ISIS, the extremist group currently — and violently — remapping the Middle East. Click over to Google <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syria/@34.802075,38.996815,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x1518e6dc413cc6a7:0x877546f4882af620">maps</a> and you will see, clearly delineated, the lines between Iraq and Syria. These are two distinct countries to you or I, but not to the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In 2006 the group produced the following <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6843611/14-maps-that-explain-isis">map</a> of their plan for Iraq and Syria:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/assets/Bp2WnwaCYAIX1Ki.0.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="352" /></p>
<p>And, as of September 2014, here is what their map actually looks like:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/assets/isis_control_0922.0.png" alt="" width="605" height="340" /></p>
<p>The myth of maps is powerful, clearly. In the context of ISIS, we read a lot about the The Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 in which the British and French arbitrarily drew lines on a map — much like King Lear dividing his kingdom based on his daughters’ performance of their love for him — of the Middle East that pretty much persists today. When I lived in Kenya, a country with something like 70 distinct ethnic groups bundled together between another set of British-made borders, the subjectiveness of the map was tangible. And, when, in 2007, shortly after I moved back home, the country erupted in ethnic fueled violence, I watched from afar with sadness but little surprise as members of those ethnic groups raged against each other.</p>
<p>Here in the West we are relatively clueless to the myth of maps, though the periodic redrawing of voting districts should probably awaken us from our slumber. But elsewhere, as we are (or should be) seeing, the effects of this pervasive myth are felt daily. But perhaps, even in these places, though they fight against it, the myth goes unrecognized. What is needed is a mythifying of the myth of the map.</p>
<p>What would it mean to “mythify” the myth of the map? As, Barthes suggests, “The best weapon against myth is perhaps to mythify it in its turn, and so to produce an artificial myth: and this reconstituted myth will in fact be a mythology.” In terms of maps, Wood writes, mythifying maps “strips the myth from the map of the world and holds it up to ask whether it is one we want to live by.”</p>
<p>If we force others to accept the myth of the map, it seems, eventually they will reject the myth violently. This is by no means an affirmation of the actions of ISIS, so much as a guess at what led to their violent revolt. But if we mythify the map, perhaps we can preempt this violence. I don’t know exactly what this looks like, but I know that we better figure it out — sooner, rather than later.</p>

<p>I like maps. Is that too basic a way to start? Maybe, but it’s true. I’ve created my own maps in the past, using Google Maps — favorite restaurants in my neighborhood in Jersey City, the route I took and the stops I made while traveling by air through South Sudan, and a few small projects for freelance jobs. So I was excited to work with Neatline, which I understood to be Google Maps on steroids, or whatever performance enhancing drugs academics take.</p>
<p>I immediately knew that I wanted to do something with the Instagram photo/essays that I’ve been all but obsessing over, but, initially, I ran into a problem. I was primarily following the work of Jeff Sharlet on Instagram, and his project began very local. The first few photos in his series take place in the same Dunkin Donuts in a small New Hampshire/Vermont border town. Not a terribly interesting map.</p>
<p>But then, a couple of exciting things happened, which broadened the scope of the project as well as landed a few more points on the map. That is, other writers started trying out the genre that Sharlet seemed to have pioneered. A few pieces popped up by writers in Brooklyn, NY, and a few more in Norway. Then, perhaps upon seeing the appeal of posting from exotic locales, Sharlet himself posted photos from a recent trip to Russia, where he was reporting for GQ. And, finally, in an email conversation with Sharlet, he pointed me to the work of Neil Shea, National Geographic photographer who, Sharlet told me, had been posting photo/essays to Instagram for weeks ahead of Sharlet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed like I was looking at an international movement, which seemed tailor-made for Neatline. I would have data points to add to both the map and the timeline, and in this way, I could visualize the birth of a new genre.</p>
<p>This was the impetus that got me started, but then some problems set in — namely, how to preserve the all-important medium while archiving these pieces. Clearly, embedding won’t work because embedded content is still tied to its original medium. If the photographer/writer takes the post down or quits Instagram, or if Instagram goes out of business, the content goes too.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to download the photos and copy the text from Instagram and add them to Omeka as new text records. In each record, I link to the original content, but if that content goes away, the worst that will happen is that my links will be broken. But then there is the question of copyright. It appears that Instagram allows users to retain the rights to their photos and they ask that anyone who embeds a public photo from Instagram include a link back to the original. I took this to mean that if the content creator does not want me to post their photos/text, they can ask me to take them down. To date, I have secured permission from only Jeff Sharlet.</p>
<p>One other issue that came up: though Instagram allows users to geolocate their photos, many do not. In these cases, the location on the map was an approximation based on context from the photographer/writer’s Instagram page or information inside the caption. If I decide to continue this project, it seems that collaboration with the photographer/writer will be necessary. For example, I mentioned to Sharlet in one of our early conversations that it would be helpful if he geotagged his photos, and was delighted to note in recent postings that he has done just that.</p>
<p>If this Instagram photo/essay thing does become its own genre, I think it is important to catalogue, consider, and write about it as it unfolds. And, it seems that Omeka and Neatline are the right tools for the job.</p>

			</h2> <p>[caption id="attachment_284" align="alignleft" width="190"]<img class="size-full wp-image-284" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-10-15-at-2.21.16-PM.png" alt="The Paper" width="190" height="267" /> Vol. I No. 1 of The Paper, Dec. 3, 1965[/caption]</p>
<p>When I began the process of selecting a “key project” to study for this assignment, I knew I wanted to look at a project that involved periodicals. I had a faint notion, based on my knowledge of the Viral Texts project and a few others, that periodicals were vast and mostly untapped resources of literature, but, until I began searching, I wasn’t clear how this might relate to my interest in literary journalism.</p>
<p>And then, I found “<a href="http://www.msupaper.org">MiningThe Paper</a>” (currently titled, simply, “The Paper”), a site by Peter Leonard of Yale University, which archives and makes accessible issues of the alternative student publication, <i>The Paper. </i>Created at Michigan State University by Michael Kindman in 1965, <i>The Paper</i> has been called “the first campus-based underground newspaper in American history.” The digital version of the paper, which I found via DHCommons, has great potential as a DH project, but it also appears to have many problems and limitations.</p>
<p>Anyways, that is what I thought, until I contacted Peter Leonard and asked him what plans he has for future development of the site. He shared with me his work-in-progress, which, at current, is not visible to the casual browser of the site (as such, I’m not sharing links to this portion of the site, until I have Leonard’s permission). As it seems there are now two versions of this evolving project, I will first describe what I found before contacting Leonard, and then move to what he shared with me.</p>
<p>The site itself is attractive, if sparse. It’s color palette is limited to black and white and in that, as well as in the bold but simple banner text, the site mirrors the look of the actual newspaper itself. This similarity is hard to miss, as the content of the site below the banner is a grid of images of <i>The Paper</i>’s front pages from December, 1965, to April, 1967. Additionally, sprinkled throughout are images of articles and flyers relating to <i>The Paper.</i> Each issue of the paper can be viewed and/or downloaded. The download link initiates a PDF download, and the view link takes the user to a Google Docs viewer where the full text of the newspaper is accessible and searchable in the browser.</p>
<p>While it is incredibly useful to have access to the full text of this revolutionary newspaper, that is about all one gets. That is to say, as far as the casual viewer is concerned, the site is just a repository for PDF files. There is limited search functionality via a Google search bar at the bottom of the page, which has been set to search only the PDF directory (Leonard, himself, described it as “sort of a hack”).</p>
<p>I have lost myself reading individual stories from  several different issues of the paper — and I’m developing a working thesis about the roots of contemporary literary journalism in underground, and often student-produced papers such as this one — but in order for this project to be at all useful, it would have to be more than just a page with links. At the bottom of the site, there is a note stating that it is “a work in progress.” With that in mind, as I noted, I contacted Peter Leonard to inquire as to his plans to further develop the site.</p>
<p>And that is when things got interesting. Less than hour after I contacted Leonard, he wrote back to me. He informed me that he was nearly finished scanning additional issues of <i>The Paper</i> and told me that he actually had been working on a topic modeling feature. Leonard noted that he adapted the code for his site (and, while he was at it, the name) from Robert Nelson’s “Mining the <i>Dispatch.</i>”</p>
<p>On a “hidden” topics page, Leonard lists 10 topics including journalism, Vietnam, music, counter culture, and student government, among others. In his email, he noted that cultural criticism and student government topics seemed to have worked particularly well. So, too, I found, did the journalism category in which the self-conscious (and self-protective) nature of the paper is very much on display in its on-again, off-again letters to readers regarding its apparently tenuous relationship with the administration of MSU.</p>
<p>Suddenly, having been offered a glimpse into the future of “Mining the <i>Paper,</i>” I see great potential for what this project will become, and what it can offer to future projects that are like it. That is, by utilizing the excellent work of Robert Nelson on “Mining the <i>Dispatch,</i>” Leonard exhibits the kind of community building that DH seems to thrive on. Additionally, Leonard wrote that he may try to run Ben Schmidt’s Bookworm on the data, but noted that it might not be so useful given the short timeframe, and thus limited quantity, of the data.</p>
<p>I can see <i>The Paper</i> becoming an important resource for scholars from a variety of disciplines, spanning history, journalism, and English literature. Of course, the 1960s were a tumultuous time in the United States, and <i>The Paper</i> is an important primary source with much to offer. I feel strongly that sites like <i>The Paper</i> and, presumably, other similar resources would prove eminently useful in uncovering some excellent and important examples of mid-20th century literary journalism. And, as noted above, I am eager to dive in and see if I can’t infer a relationship between the creative acts of journalism happening at places like MSU and the popularity of “New Journalism” in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Leonard’s work-in-progress models what is most exciting to me about the Digital Humanities. The collegial nature of his process, both in working from Nelson’s code and then in his willingness to share his work with me, the in-progress aspect, and, perhaps most importantly, the opportunity to uncover important documents that might otherwise have been lost.</p>
<p>In closing his initial email to me, Peter Leonard asked — just out of curiosity, he noted — whether I had known about <i>The Paper</i> prior to discovering his site. I told him that I had not. I get the sense that this is a large part of why he created it.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/10/08/messing-around-with-tei.html">"Messing Around" with TEI</a>
			</h2> <p>If I’m honest, I probably went into the TEI practicum a little over confident. It’s coding. I know coding. When I finished my MA in 2005, I needed a job. My Master’s thesis was in creative writing — I wrote a collection of short stories, but try as I might, I couldn’t land any of them in a literary magazine. So, discouraged as I was, I wanted to find work unrelated to writing and academia. I wanted to do something easier.</p>
<p>I ended up falling back on a hobby that had developed into a skill: HTML coding. I inflated my skills a bit on my resumé, took a job that started me out as a glorified secretary, and taught myself to really code. To this day, I still freelance a bit.</p>
<p>So, TEI. I’ve come across XML in my years as a web developer. I can do this, I thought. Well, not so fast.</p>
<p>It’s not that I can’t do it. After a few weeks of “screwing around,” I’m beginning to feel confident, but I had made a crucial error at the start of this process. I was conflating the kind of coding that TEI requires, with that of web development. On first being introduced to TEI my teammates and I wondered about the visual display. Where’s the browser?, I asked. Where can I see what this is going to look like when I’m done?</p>
<p>Turns out, what it looked like is what it’s going to look like. TEI is coding and building, but it’s not GUI. (Though I am now aware of TEI Boilerplate, as some of my classmates have used it to post their code for this project.) This required some reorientation on my part, but in the end, it’s a welcome realization. If we use TEI to markup a text for the purpose of displaying it online in a web page, it feels like we’re somehow reducing the text’s import. I know that this comes from a personal bias — the same bias that drove me from academia into web design in 2005. I was burnt out from the hard work of reading, analyzing, and writing. I needed something less taxing: web design.</p>
<p>If TEI was just web design, it would be something less. But, as this project has shown me, it really is about visualizing the critical process. Critics analyze texts, make choices, and form interpretations — TEI makes that process (mostly) transparent.</p>
<p>But then, I’m just starting out. Already I can see a number of practical applications of TEI in my own proposed area of study. I’m ready to get to work.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/10/02/theory-vs-practice-or-the-practice-of-theory.html">Theory vs. Practice, or the Practice of Theory</a>
			</h2> <p><a href="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mind-the-gap.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-267 size-medium" src="/assets/mind-the-gap-300x239.jpg" alt="mind-the-gap" width="300" height="239" /></a>This past week I’ve been thinking a lot about the usefulness (or not?) of theory in two seemingly disparate fields, ecocriticism and the digital humanities. Though these fields are different in many ways, what they have in common is that they’re both fairly new (as far as academic disciplines go) and they are both embroiled in a debate over the role of theory versus practice. What is the role of theory? Do we need it? Or can we somehow skip past all the theorizing and get to work?</p>
<p>You’ll forgive, I hope, my high-school-essay-style invocation of Dictionary.com here, but it’s probably important at the outset to define <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theory?s=t">theory</a> as “a particular conception or view of something to be done or of the method of doing it; a system of rules or principles.” Now that that’s out of the way, it seems clear to me that there is no work without theory. That is, even if we imagine that we can forego theorizing and move right into practice, we are still, in a way, theorizing.</p>
<p>Let’s look first to how the question of theory versus practice is manifest in ecocriticism. This debate was prompted, in large part, by a couple of essays published in <i>Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment</i> (<a href="http://www.asle.org/site/publications/isle/">ISLE</a>, I’m not linking to the individual essays as they require a subscription). The first was "Theorizing in a Space of Ambivalent Openness: Ecocriticism and Ecophobia," published in the spring of 2009, by S. C. Estok, who argues that the field of ecocriticism is undertheorized. Estok proposes, as a solution, the idea of “ecophopia.” That is, ecocritism should develop a theory in response to “an irrational and groundless hatred of the natural world.” This ecophobia is motivated, in part, by “the constitutional moment in history that gives us the biblical imperative to control everything that lives.” A theory that works against this, then, is what that leads us to “nuanced discussions of the cultural, intellectual, and environmental history surrounding a given text.”</p>
<p>The counterpoint was offered by S. K. Robisch, who, in a brazen essay titled “The Woodshed,” published in the fall of 2009, argues that a pursuit of theory is “masturbatory” and “relinquishes thorough analysis in a quest for the limelight.” Robisch wants an ecocriticism rooted in activism, one that writes “for clarity,” and calls would-be ecocritics out of theory “and into the real of the world of nature that you deny with all your hearts in your blind quest for the transcendent.” Robisch’s essay is remarkable for being full of violent imagery, including in the essay’s titular “woodshed” where, presumably, beatings occur. Robisch concludes with an inflammatory call to action, against theory; he suggests that he and those that agree with him might attend an academic conference “carrying water balloons filled with red paint, bottles of Karo syrup or bags of sand, maybe some big picket signs with the word ‘Bullshit’ printed on them.” He insists, “Let’s go PETA on these nature fakers, these seated hikers.”</p>
<p>This heated debate prompted a response in ISLE from Louisa Mackenzie and Stephanie Posthumus, who act as mediators, encouraging readers to generously consider both sides. They wisely insist that even the rejection of theory is a theory in itself. And this is my jumping off point into the similar debate that is occurring, though, at least so far, in a far more civil manner, in the digital humanities. There, the debate is framed in the conflict between “hacking and yacking,” that is, theorizing or doing the work. Stephan Ramsay is in part responsible for this demarcation in his <a href="http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/08/whos-in-and-whos-out/">assertion</a> at the 2011 MLA conference that “If you are not making anything, you are not...a digital humanist.” He further clarified this point in a blog <a href="http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/11/on-building/">post</a> titled “On Building,” in which he notes that the “exciting and enabling” commonality of people in dh involves “moving from reading and critiquing to building and making.” This is like Robisch’s call for critics to get into the “real world,” as opposed to a “blind quest for the transcendent.” Except, you know, way less inflammatory.</p>
<p>So what is the role of theory in the digital humanities? Can we forego it altogether in the name of making things? Less yacking and more hacking? Here, I think, Tara McPherson’s <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29">essay</a> in <i>Debates in Digital Humanities, </i>titled “Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation” is useful. McPherson’s chief concern is the question of why issues such as race are not more often considered in the digital humanities, and in answer she offers the history of the UNIX operating system (stay with me, it ends up making sense). UNIX was developed in the 1960s, and, McPherson suggests, its architecture models the “common sense” of the time, which preferred “A lenticular logic,” which is “a logic of the fragment or the chunk, a way of seeing the world as discrete modules or nodes, a mode that suppresses relation and context.” That is, segregation was built into the computer systems in which we continue to operate. She writes of the 1960s, “this moment is overdetermined by the ways in which the United States is widely coming to process race and other forms of difference in more covert registers.” Some digital humanists are under the impression that we can fragment theory from work because the systems we depend on for our work are based on fragmentation.</p>
<p>McPherson is drawing on the definition of “common sense” put forth by Antonio Gramsci, who defined it as, “the way in which a particular group responds to ‘certain problems posed by reality which are quite specific’ at a particular time.” (Paraphrased by McPherson) Clearly this is theory, corresponding to the notion put forth by Mackenzie and Posthumus that “all ways of reading are theoretical inasmuch as, quite simply, they are based on positions.”</p>
<p>So there is no escaping theory. Even in using the systems at hand, we are participating in theory. The way forward, I think, involves recognizing this, and in recognizing as Moya Bailey writes in her <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/all-the-digital-humanists-are-white-all-the-nerds-are-men-but-some-of-us-are-brave-by-moya-z-bailey/">essay</a> “All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave” in the <i>Journal of Digital Humanities,</i> “identities inform both theory and practice in digital humanities.” Not only are we operating on theory when we begin our work in a particular field, but our very identifies shape the theory, as well as the practice, that we are involved in. Adeline Koh pushes this even further when she <a href="http://www.adelinekoh.org/blog/2012/05/21/more-hack-less-yack-modularity-theory-and-habitus-in-the-digital-humanities/">writes</a>, “all forms of shared, cultural understandings, whether they come under the umbrella terms ‘common sense,’ ‘tradition’ or ‘ritual,’ are founded upon an important obscuring of their own particular socio-political specificity…to ignore this specificity is troubling.”</p>
<p>We are always theorizing — theory is built into the work we do and the tools we use to do it, and is further shaped by our very identities. And that’s okay. It’s important. Let’s understand that, and go from debating the role of theory to actually articulating the theories from which we are operating, and then, finally, we can get to work.</p>

				<a class="post-link" href="/blog/2014/09/09/you-cant-go-home-again-wandering-the-new-media-wilderness.html">You Can't Go Home Again: Wandering the New Media Wilderness</a>
			</h2> <p><a href="http://www.uwm.edu/Course/mythology/1200/2001.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/Odyssey.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>You may think you’re sitting at your computer (or staring at your phone) and browsing the internet, but you're actually wandering around in the wilderness. Think Moses and the Israelites in the desert post-Egypt, pre-Promised Land. Or, if you prefer a less Biblical analogy, think Odysseus making his 10-year journey back to Ithaca. That’s you. You're Odysseus every time you go online.</p>
<p>The fact is, the internet is still new, and we’re still figuring out how to use it — and how it uses us. This wilderness wandering extends into every area of online life. Journalists and scholars of media are in a constant state of hand-wringing over what the internet has wrought for their practice and discipline. People in IT are constantly finding and solving and creating new problems related to standards, privacy, and security. And, of course, academics in all disciplines run the gamut of reactions to the introduction of the digital into their mostly analogue spheres, from over-eager acceptance to full-on resistance.</p>
<p>And so, many people, in a variety of fields, have taken to choosing sides and making grand proclamations about the value (or not) of the internet as a reliable source of news and information, a distraction or a boon to productivity, a creative engine or limiting force, and so on.</p>
<p>Others are perhaps more guarded, but nonetheless there is a ground swell of pro- and anti-internet commentary. We see this impulse in academia as well. Since 2009, when the media caught on to the increasing popularity of the Digital Humanities, there has been constant debate over the merits of utilizing so-called “new media” in academic work. Though, as many, including Lisa Marie Rhody of George Mason University, have <a href="http://differences.dukejournals.org/content/25/1/1.full.pdf+html">pointed out</a>, “everyone is already a digital humanist, insofar as it is a condition of contemporary research that we must ask questions about the values, technologies, and economies that organize and redistribute scholarly communication.”</p>
<p>Yet, the debate remains largely polarized (and polarizing). That is not to say that there isn’t a small but growing number of scholars, including Rhody, who take a more nuanced approach to the question of Digital Humanities specifically, and more generally the impact of the internet on daily life.</p>
<p>Among these is Alan Liu, English professor at UCSB, and one of the most respected voices among Digital Humanists. In his introduction to <i>A Companion to Digital Literary Studies</i>, titled “Imagining the New Media Encounter," Liu puts the current media landscape into its proper historical context and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=hcWApGaV48cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22of+this+tale.+There+are+more+and+less+capable+imaginations+of+the+new%22+%22was+meaning+enough.+In+the+seventeenth+century+our+ancestors+still%22+%22account+in+Tristes+Tropiques+of+the+tribal+chief+who+imitated%22+&amp;ots=9VT-bSooQI&amp;sig=6sVS_g3LM7PJJKqmUKo0CYyCSE4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">describes</a> the moment we are in as “an encounter rather than a border.” That is, when new media arises, it is not as if we cross a boarder into a new era, as we might walk through a doorway from outside to in, rather we live for some time in an “unpredictable zone of contact — more borderland than border line,” as Liu writes. Borderland. Wilderness.</p>
<p>Using Jean-François Lyotard's concept, Liu describes this zone of contact as a “<i>pagus,</i>” or “the tricky frontier around a town where one deals warily with strangers because even the lowliest beggar may turn out to be a god, or vice versa.”</p>
<p>This is an apt description for where we are, and it is clear from history that frontier or borderlands are always rife with conflict. Think, if a contemporary analogy is necessary, of the disputed territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Is there any wonder then, that many commentators, within academia and in the more general media, seem to be taking sides?</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, my friend and colleague at the blog we co-edit, Patrolmag.com, wrote a <a href="http://www.patrolmag.com/2014/08/25/david-sessions/the-state-of-the-internet-is-awful-and-everybody-knows-it/">piece</a> that has garnered quite a bit of interest among those working in the media titled “The State of the Internet is Awful, and Everybody Knows It.” In it, he details his own experience working as a journalist exclusively for web publications and his early idealism about the medium. After seven years of working for publications including the now defunct AOL news site “Politics Daily” and most recently “The Daily Beast,” however, Sessions writes, “Things look a lot different now. The internet won, and despite killing off thousands of jobs in the print industry, it created many more than expected in an ever-multiplying array of new web ventures.”</p>
<p>But now that internet won, he continues, “it’s increasingly unclear that was a good thing.” Sessions cites the example of John R. MacArthur, publisher of <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, who has long resisted the internet as a space for serious journalism and continues to insist that readers who want to read Harper’s online must have a print subscription in order to so. MacArthur feels vindicated in his decision, according to a recent <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/business/media/harpers-publisher-standing-firm-in-his-defense-of-print-and-paywall.html?_r=0">article</a>, based on his thesis that the web is bad for writers as it demands too frequent output and offers minimal compensation, bad for publishers who can’t compete with the likes of Facebook and Google for ad revenue, and bad for readers who are too distracted reading online to effectively absorb information.</p>
<p>Certainly MacArthur and Sessions have a point, but within the context of Alan Liu’s “pagus,” it is much too early to discern winners from losers. MacArthur’s observations about journalism on the web may be true, and falling back on the traditional print model, what MacArthur calls “journalism’s golden age,” probably seems, at this moment, like the safest bet. In fact, Liu writes that one of the key attributes of a new media encounter is that “narratives of new media encounter are reversible.”</p>
<p>That said, this reversibility doesn’t typically look like a retreat, rather, Liu writes, “media shifts have an impact only after long temporal and institutional lags full of indirection.” That is the period we are in — both in the general media landscape, but also in academia within the context of Digital Humanities.</p>
<p>“You can't go back home to your family, back home to your childhood,” Thomas Wolfe writes in his aptly titled novel, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-8JzHJaxhooC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=you%20can't%20go%20home%20again&amp;pg=PT821#v=snippet&amp;q=%22you%20can't%20go%20back%20home%20to%20your%20family%22&amp;f=false"><i>You Can’t Go Home Again</i></a><i>. </i>He continues, “...back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time…” Wolfe was writing simultaneously about changes in American and German societies, changes that led to a reorganizing of American culture after the WWI and the Stock Market Crash, and the rise of Nazism in Germany.</p>
<p>We can’t go home again to a time before the internet, but perhaps we can take comfort in the fact this current new media moment is history repeating itself. We’ve done this before — transitioning from an oral culture to manuscripts, from manuscripts to print, and now from print to digital — and, undoubtedly, we will do it again. As history has shown, patience is required, and flexibility. Like Odysseus, who missteps, encounters challenges, and yet eventually reaches his Ithaca, this is how we will make our way through our contemporary media pagus. Just in time, probably, for our next jaunt in the wilderness.</p>
