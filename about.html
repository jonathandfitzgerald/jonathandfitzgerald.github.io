<p>Hi. My name is Jonathan D. Fitzgerald, but everybody calls me Fitz.</p>
<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the English Department at Northeastern University, a research assistant for the Viral Texts Project and Women Writers Project, a Fellow in the Northeastern University Humanities Center, and managing editor of DHQ. My research fields include the history of literary journalism, women literary journalists, nineteenth and twentieth century American nonfiction, and Digital Humanities. My current research focuses on considering the role sentimental writing (particularly by women) played in the origin of literary journalism.</p>
<p>Before enrolling at Northeastern, I worked as a freelance web developer and journalist, with articles and essays appearing in publications such as The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and others. Links to some of those
    are <a href="/writing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, Bondfire Books published my short ebook titled <i>Not Your Mother’s Morals: How the New Sincerity is Changing Pop Culture for the Better</i>. You can read more about the book <a title="Not Your Mother’s Morals" href="/writing/nymm/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I earned a BA from Gordon College and a MA from the University of Massachusetts in Boston, both in English. Since then, I've taught writing and journalism at several colleges and universities in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.</p>
