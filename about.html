<p>Hi. My name is Jonathan D. Fitzgerald, but everybody calls me Fitz.</p>
<p>I'm a second year PhD student in the English Department, a research assistant for the Global Viral Texts Project, and managing editor of DHQ. My interests include Literary Journalism, 20th century American literature, and Digital Humanities. My current research focuses on using classification methods to identify genres in digital newspaper archives. Before enrolling at Northeastern, I worked as a freelance web developer and journalist, with articles and essays appearing in publications such as The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and others. Links to some of those are <a href="writing.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, Bondfire Books published my short ebook titled <i>Not Your Mother’s Morals: How the New Sincerity is Changing Pop Culture for the Better</i>. You can read more about the book <a title="Not Your Mother’s Morals" href="/writing/nymm/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I earned a BA from Gordon College and a MA from the University of Massachusetts in Boston, both in English. Since then, I've taught writing and journalism at several colleges and universities in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.</p>
