<p style="text-align: left;"> Hi. My name is Jonathan D. Fitzgerald, but everybody calls me Fitz.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm a PhD student in English at Northeastern University. My writing, which to date has focused on the dynamic role of religion in culture has appeared in The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, On Faith, Books and Culture, Christianity Today, Religion Dispatches, Killing the Buddha, The Metro, and <a title="Writing" href="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/category/writing/">many more</a>. I'm an editor of Patrolmag.com, an occasional Huffington Post Religion blogger, and a former columnist for Patheos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2013, Bondfire Books published my short ebook titled “Not Your Mother’s Morals: How the New Sincerity is Changing Pop Culture for the Better." You can read more about the book <a title="Not Your Mother’s Morals" href="http://www.jonathandfitzgerald.com/writing/not-your-mothers-morals/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I earned a BA from Gordon College and a MA from the University of Massachusetts in Boston, both in English. Since then, I've taught writing and journalism at several colleges and universities in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.</p>
